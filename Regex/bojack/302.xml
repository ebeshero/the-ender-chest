<p>Whoa.
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>So, that was weird.
</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Wait.
Why did you think that was weird?
</p><timestamp>00:00:20</timestamp>
<p>You know, you and me together, weird.
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>So it's not because
I did that talking penis thing, right?
</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>Just the general concept of us
sleeping together that's weird, right?
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.

<p>Oh, my God, 2007?
Is that what time it is?
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>I gotta get my Uggs on and get to work.
</p><timestamp>00:00:41</timestamp>
<p>Well, you sure you don't want
to just hang around for a little bit?
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>- I got no plans.
- No, sadly, I have to go to my job,
to help my boss find gigs
for you to turn down.
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>If Marv brought me something good,
I would do it.
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>Besides, I'm still decompressing
from my last gig.

<p>What, you're just gonna stay at home

</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p>Don't climb up my ass. I invited you
to play hooky and hang out with me.
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p>I got a new HD DVD player.
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>Let's get wrecked and get Shreked.
</p><timestamp>00:01:12</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, last night was fun
and you're sweet, sort of.
</p><timestamp>00:01:15</timestamp>
<p>- I don't want to make a thing of this.
- We agree. It's not a thing.
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p>- Not a thing.
- Definitely not a thing.
</p><timestamp>00:01:21</timestamp>
<p>No, this is not a thing.

<p>That's ridonkulous.
You have to like someone.

That's like saying you like Fergie.

<p>{\an8}The show, about the guy in the mob?
That's what my dad does.

<p>{\an8}Whoa! Hey, speaking of mobs,

<p>{\an8}You're looking at the new face

</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>And she liked it? This I gotta see.
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>Talk to you later.
</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>P.C., where are you hiding?
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>Right out here, Marv, same place
I've been for the last 14 years.
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>Get in here and tell me
what scripts I read this weekend.
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>We have three standouts here.
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>A feature called
<i>No Country For Old Men.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>- It's about a hunter who--
- <subtitle>snoring</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, I fell asleep for a second.
Because that title's too long.
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p><i>No Country For Old Men</i>
<i>It's About A Hunter Who?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>Pass.
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>- Aaah!
- Titles should be two words.
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p><i>Pretty Woman. Beautiful Girls.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p><i>Private Parts.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>Then you might not like this next one,
<i>There Will Be Blood?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>There will <i>not </i>be blood.
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>I would have accepted
<i>There Will, </i>or <i>Be Blood.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:23</timestamp>
<p>- Firm pass.
- Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>This last one is really special.
</p><timestamp>00:05:27</timestamp>
<p>It's a TV pilot from a veteran sitcom
writer named Cuddlywhiskers called...
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>- Hmm... <i>Mitch's Life.</i>
- Now <i>there's </i>a title.
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>I think if we attach the right talent,
this could be a hit.
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>You know who'd be great?
BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>Don't make me laugh, because I have
a heart condition and it could kill me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>Every little thing I bring that guy,
he turns down.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>I think with the right project,
BoJack could--
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>Bup, bup, bup! P.C., do I get <i>you </i>coffee
and pick up your dry cleaning
and buy you peek-a-boo negligees
for strange women
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>- you saw at the train station once?
- No.
</p><timestamp>00:06:03</timestamp>
<p>Then how about I don't do your job
and you don't do my job?
</p><timestamp>00:06:07</timestamp>
<p>You know,
I would like to be an agent someday.
</p><timestamp>00:06:10</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah, someday, sure.
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>But for now,
you're learning from one of the greats.
</p><timestamp>00:06:15</timestamp>
<p>Mark my words.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>The best agent in the world
couldn't get that joker off his ass.
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>Hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>doorbell rings</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I brought you Four Loko.
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>I brought four Four Lokos.
That's 16 Lokos.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>Finally someone brings me
an adequate amount of Lokos.
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>Are you trying to get me drunk?
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
You <i>were </i>trying to get me drunk.
</p><timestamp>00:06:39</timestamp>
<p>Where are you taking me,
what am I wearing?
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>To a meeting, and your clothes.
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>
<p>Is this a fedora?
What am I, Jason Mirzizzerzaz?
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>- I don't know.
- You know who.
</p><timestamp>00:06:47</timestamp>
<p>I knew you wouldn't take this meeting
if I didn't trick you into it.
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>Cuddlywhiskers has a great script
and wants to meet you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>I have a script for you. It's called
"The BoJack Says No Chronicles".
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p>Fade in, Princess Carolyn's car.
</p><timestamp>00:06:57</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn: "Hey, BoJack, you want
to do this dumbass thing?" Act break.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>Act two.
BoJack turns to Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>BoJack: "No, thank you." End of episode.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>Hey! Aren't you the horse
from <i>Horsin' Around?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> You see, this is why I don't
go out amongst the not-famouses.
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>Just do me a favor
and take this meeting.
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>

we can do that weird French thing
you saw in that Internet video.

<p>Ooh, parkour?

<p>This show came to me
when I was in rehab.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>I realized I'm only here on this earth
for a bit, why not dig deeper?
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>- Huh.
- Don't get me wrong.
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm proud of the seven years
I spent on <i>Krill &amp;amp; Grace.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:36</timestamp>
<p>That show did so much
for the way society views krill people.
</p><timestamp>00:07:39</timestamp>
<p>That show didn't make me happy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>The awards, the money
didn't make me happy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>Did you try spending the money on things?
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>I started to feel like I was trapped
in a giant plastic ball.
</p><timestamp>00:07:49</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, meet my lovely assistant,
Jill Filipowicz.
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>- Hey.
- Hi.
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>- Did I say you could speak, wench?
- You can't talk to me like that.

<p><subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>- Clean up that mess this instant!
- No. I'm a dirty girl.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>- Uh...
- I'm filthy.
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>- You are being very bad.
- You'll have to punish me later.
</p><timestamp>00:08:08</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>both chuckling</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>Jill and I have a very...
special relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>Want to tell me about the show?
I hear it's great.
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p>I've worked on great shows
my whole career.
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>Great shows are easy.
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>I didn't become president of the <i>Lampoon</i>
so I could make "great" shows.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>- <i>Harvard Lampoon.</i>
- Yeah, I got it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:25</timestamp>
<p>I'm trying to do something different here.
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>- Something that lasts.
- Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:08:29</timestamp>
<p>Think about it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>If you're ready to finally stop being
"The Horse" from <i>Horsin' Around,</i>
send me an e-mail:
Cuddlywhiskers@harvard.edu.
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>- That's H-A-R--
- I got it.

that pet name ironically, right?
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>Yes, Wayne.
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, check it out,
a rejection letter from <i>The New Yorker.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>That magazine is for white people.
White people are the worst, right, guys?
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p>Yup.
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>"Dear Diane.
We are sorry to say that your piece,
</p><timestamp>00:09:03</timestamp>
<p>'An Open Letter to Open Letters',
wasn't right for us,
despite its evident merit."
Do you know what this means?
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>Caring leads to disappointment?
Trying is stupid and so is having dreams?
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>Someone gave my piece a read
and decided against it.
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>Their journalistic style
couldn't be more outmoded.
</p><timestamp>00:09:19</timestamp>
<p>- Satire? More like "sa-tired."
- I never even thought they'd read it.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>"Talk of the Town"?
More like "Schlock of the Clown".
</p><timestamp>00:09:27</timestamp>
<p>Then they typed me a letter
that said it had "obvious merit".
</p><timestamp>00:09:31</timestamp>
<p>"Shouts and Murmurs"?
More like "Louts and..."
</p><timestamp>00:09:34</timestamp>
<p>What rhymes with murmurs?
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p>For two people
who don't like <i>The New Yorker,</i>
you know a lot about the different
sections of <i>The New Yorker.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p>And then Cuddlywhiskers said:
</p><timestamp>00:09:43</timestamp>
<p>"What if we stopped thinking of TV
as a conduit to tell stories
and thinking of it
as a conduit to tell truth?"
</p><timestamp>00:09:48</timestamp>
<p>And I was like: "Damn, this guy
must have gone to Yale or something."
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>Sounds like you two really hit it off.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>We were like Heidi and Spencer
up in there.
</p><timestamp>00:09:56</timestamp>
<p>So you're gonna do the show?
</p><timestamp>00:09:58</timestamp>
<p>- Nah. Timing's really off right now.
- <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
iPhone's coming out this year,
I need to gear up for that.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>I'm done. That's it, I'm tired
of bending over backwards for you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>I mean this in all seriousness,
professionally or in bed?
</p><timestamp>00:10:09</timestamp>
<p>Why won't you do this?
Give me one good reason.
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>Because his show sounds incredible.
And what if... I'm not?
</p><timestamp>00:10:17</timestamp>
<p>What if there's a reason the only thing
I'm known for is <i>Horsin' Around?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, you are amazing.
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>You're bright and you're funny
and you're handsome and you're talented.
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>
<p>But if you can't see that,
then you're the biggest,
dumbest piece of shit in the world.
</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>pop music playing</subtitle>
- <subtitle>laughter and chatter</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:40</timestamp>
<p>How long do we have to stay in here?
</p><timestamp>00:10:42</timestamp>
<p>- It's called Seven Minutes in Heaven.
- Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>We don't have to kiss.
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>I know you'd rather be in here
with Kimber.
</p><timestamp>00:10:48</timestamp>
<p>That's not true. It's just that, Emily...
</p><timestamp>00:10:51</timestamp>
<p>- What?
- I've never kissed anyone before.
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>That's okay.
Maybe we can try with each other?
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>That way, when you're in here with Kimber
one day, you'll know exactly what to do.
</p><timestamp>00:11:00</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so how should we do it?
French style, Eskimo, Butterfly?
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>I'll tell you. I know exactly what to do
because I practice all the time
with a picture of Adam Brody--
No, I don't!
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:12</timestamp>
<p>Just close your eyes,
and we move our faces toward each other.
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p>- Okay.
- Until we...
</p><timestamp>00:11:25</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
- <subtitle>Marv</subtitle> Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>Well, the elusive BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>You do, huh? Hey, Princess Carolyn,
guess who just got BoJack a job.
</p><timestamp>00:11:36</timestamp>
<p>You... are the secretary
of a wonderful agent.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>Now go pick up
a pair of satin crotchless undies.
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>I saw a stewardess
at the Yum Yum Donuts.
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>We did not make eye contact.

<p>Aaah!
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>- Jeez, sleep much?
- Jeez, watch me sleep much?
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>Well, I couldn't sleep.
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>I kept thinking about
today's first read-through.
</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>These things
are always so nerve-wracking,
to sit there and perform
for all these people like some kind of a--
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>- Professional actor?
- Very funny.
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>- Before I forget, I got you a present.
- <subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:21</timestamp>
<p>It's a box...
with crinkly tissue paper inside it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>How did you know?
</p><timestamp>00:12:27</timestamp>
<p>Thank you
for putting this whole thing together.
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>Even though I still can't believe
I let you talk me into this.
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>Promise me
everything's going to be okay?
</p><timestamp>00:12:34</timestamp>
<p>I promise it's gonna be great.
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>If you get scared,
look for me in the audience.
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p>I'll be there the whole time,
laughing and cheering louder than anyone.
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>- Mmm...
- Mm-mmm-mm.
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>"Mitch tosses the vodka bottle
into the garbage. Thud."
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>"Goodbye, old friend."

</p><timestamp>00:12:56</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:13:05</timestamp>
<p>Let's see what the suits say.
</p><timestamp>00:13:07</timestamp>
<p>Bet they're gonna want to bland it up,
make it appeal to middle America.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle> That's the worst part of America.
</p><timestamp>00:13:12</timestamp>
<p>Other than the bottom,
the top and most of the sides.
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, Cuddlywhiskers,
what can we say?
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>This is why you guys are the pros
and we're just the schmoes.
</p><timestamp>00:13:22</timestamp>
<p>I think what my husband
is trying to say is, "Great job."
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>Enough with the torture.
</p><timestamp>00:13:27</timestamp>
<p>Don't have to feed me to finger me.
Just lay on the notes.
</p><timestamp>00:13:29</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Our only note? No notes.
</p><timestamp>00:13:32</timestamp>
<p>- No notes?
- We love this show.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I'm calling it right now.
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>This show is gonna be as big
as <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:13:40</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gulps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>
<p>Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:13:43</timestamp>
<p>And then Justin said, "Jessica Biel?
You are un-Jessica-Bielievable."
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>- It was so funny.
- Wow.
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>It seems like you're really
in sync with this Justin guy.
</p><timestamp>00:13:54</timestamp>
<p>You should do all the things
with him that I can't do.
</p><timestamp>00:13:57</timestamp>
<p>Like eat chocolate,
or enjoy fireworks, or watch tennis.
</p><timestamp>00:14:01</timestamp>
<p>Why, tennis makes me so mad.
Why doesn't anyone ever catch the ball?
</p><timestamp>00:14:05</timestamp>
<p>Hello? Can we please get
some service in this place?
</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>
<p>I'm famous actress Jessica Biel.
I'm one of the Jessicas.
</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p>Mom, I'm finally gonna be
a published writer.
</p><timestamp>00:14:15</timestamp>
<p>My "Open Letter to Open Letters"
is going to be published in McSweeney's.
</p><timestamp>00:14:18</timestamp>
<p>Mc-What? Who's that? Some Irish?
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>No, Mom. It's a very popular website.
</p><timestamp>00:14:24</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for that scam.
</p><timestamp>00:14:26</timestamp>
<p>Website? We gotta print it out
on our own paper with our own ink?
</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p><i>- I don't think so.</i>
- Mom.
</p><timestamp>00:14:31</timestamp>
<p>And my Blockbuster original series
has been keeping me very busy.
</p><timestamp>00:14:35</timestamp>
<p>I still don't get how that's gonna work,
at all.
</p><timestamp>00:14:37</timestamp>
<p>Babe, it makes total sense.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>They make the whole season,
put it on six DVD's.
</p><timestamp>00:14:42</timestamp>
<p>People go to their local Blockbuster Video
and rent it out one disc at a time
for five days each.
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>What if someone already rented
the episodes they want?
</p><timestamp>00:14:49</timestamp>
<p>They can just get something else,
like <i>The Illusionist </i>or <i>The Prestige.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:14:53</timestamp>
<p>- Whichever one you were in.
- Do you know which one?
</p><timestamp>00:14:55</timestamp>
<p>- Do you?
- <subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:58</timestamp>
<p>- Why do you say yes to everything?
- I get excited by the possibilities.
</p><timestamp>00:15:03</timestamp>
<p>Look, a CD, at a coffee shop?
That is crazy.
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>- Buying it.
- Eh-eh eh-eh! No.
</p><timestamp>00:15:08</timestamp>
<p>- Drop it. Drop it.
- <subtitle>whimpers</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:10</timestamp>
<p>Good boy.
</p><timestamp>00:15:12</timestamp>
<p>Buzz-buzz-buzz buzz buzz-buzz!
</p><timestamp>00:15:16</timestamp>
<p>- You heard what the network said.
- Heard they loved it.
</p><timestamp>00:15:19</timestamp>
<p>Yoo-hoo! I also heard that.
</p><timestamp>00:15:21</timestamp>
<p>Exactly. The network loved it.
</p><timestamp>00:15:23</timestamp>
<p>Obviously, we're playing it too safe.
</p><timestamp>00:15:25</timestamp>
<p>If you want my opinion, fellas,
you hit oil, stop drilling.
</p><timestamp>00:15:28</timestamp>
<p>"I am an oil man.
I drink your milkshake."
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>- That'll be funny in a year or so.
- Before that got sad and weird,
you said, "If you want my opinion,"
and we don't.
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>
<p>Cuddlywhiskers, you told me
you wanted to do something different.
</p><timestamp>00:15:41</timestamp>
<p>Now we're doing something that's gonna be
"just as good as <i>Horsin' Around</i>."
</p><timestamp>00:15:44</timestamp>
<p>Is that what you wanted?
That's not why I'm here.
</p><timestamp>00:15:47</timestamp>
<p>- I know.
- I really think you're making a mistake.
</p><timestamp>00:15:49</timestamp>
<p>I'm not taking career advice
from somebody who's been
an assistant the last 14 years.
</p><timestamp>00:15:53</timestamp>
<p>Is that how you think of me?
As your agent's assistant?
</p><timestamp>00:15:56</timestamp>
<p>- What do you think you are?
- I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:15:59</timestamp>
<p>Here's some free advice:
you should know.
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you leave this to the grown-ups?
</p><timestamp>00:16:03</timestamp>
<p>Somebody needs coffee,
I'll give you a ring.
</p><timestamp>00:16:05</timestamp>
<p>Okay, best of luck.
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>clears throat</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:08</timestamp>
<p>Cuddlywhiskers,
let's give ourselves one night
to stick our dicks in this script
and go balls deep into the universe.
</p><timestamp>00:16:15</timestamp>
<p>I'm in.
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>What's that, you say?
There's a panic? At the disco?
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>I gotta go. What do you want, Toots?
</p><timestamp>00:16:24</timestamp>
<p>I want to be an agent. I think I'm ready.
</p><timestamp>00:16:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle> Again with this
"I wanna be a female agent" thing.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>They don't even have a word for it.
Uh, agentess, agentrix.
</p><timestamp>00:16:35</timestamp>
<p>- It's just called "agent", Marv, agent.
- Okay, okay!
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>
<p>You're an agent, all right?
I dub thee agent.
</p><timestamp>00:16:42</timestamp>
<p>You can even take my office,
because I quit.
</p><timestamp>00:16:45</timestamp>
<p>- What?
- Who needs the headache?
</p><timestamp>00:16:46</timestamp>
<p>Thirty years I threw into this job
and it destroyed me from the inside out.
</p><timestamp>00:16:53</timestamp>
<p>I never fell in love,
I never had a family.
</p><timestamp>00:16:57</timestamp>
<p>I never even got to give that lacy teddy
to the mean woman who worked at the DMV.
</p><timestamp>00:17:03</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> All I have is regrets.
</p><timestamp>00:17:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, I'm an agent!
I'm gonna make it after all.
</p><timestamp>00:17:15</timestamp>
<p>Whaah!
</p><timestamp>00:17:17</timestamp>
<p>First thing I'm gonna do
is get rid of that ceiling fan.
</p><timestamp>00:17:21</timestamp>
<p>How do we make it clear
that this isn't <i>Horsin' Around?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>What if in the very first scene,
we show my character
literally taking a massive dump
on a VHS copy of <i>Horsin' Around?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>What? That's insane.
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>Let's just put it in,
we can always take it out later.
</p><timestamp>00:17:38</timestamp>
<p>I want this character to be really edgy,
the kind of character Denis Leary
would be offered and then say:
</p><timestamp>00:17:43</timestamp>
<p>"This character's too edgy for me."
</p><timestamp>00:17:45</timestamp>
<p>What if he had a catchphrase
that was an anti-catchphrase?
</p><timestamp>00:17:47</timestamp>
<p>Like if every time he entered the room
he was like, "Whassup, bitches?"
</p><timestamp>00:17:52</timestamp>
<p>Not that, because that's horrible.
But something like that.
</p><timestamp>00:17:55</timestamp>
<p>Whassup, bitches?
</p><timestamp>00:17:56</timestamp>
<p>- That is so dumb.
- But kind of brilliant, right?
</p><timestamp>00:17:58</timestamp>
<p>Yes, put that in.
Put all this in, this should be the show.
</p><timestamp>00:18:01</timestamp>
<p>This should be the show.
</p><timestamp>00:18:04</timestamp>
<p>I haven't felt this alive
since the head of the Charles Regatta.
</p><timestamp>00:18:07</timestamp>
<p>- That's a Harvard thing.
- Yes. This is brilliant.
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>What if we had five minutes of him
reading a book to himself?
</p><timestamp>00:18:13</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, yes.
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>Just him turning the page.
A close-up of my eyeball.
</p><timestamp>00:18:17</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>bottle breaks</subtitle>
- The real shit, they never show that.
</p><timestamp>00:18:21</timestamp>
<p>Wow, we did it.
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p>We stayed up all night, but we really made
something new and different and daring.
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>
<p>We've changed everything but the title.
</p><timestamp>00:18:28</timestamp>
<p>Well, then, how about
we give it a new title?
</p><timestamp>00:18:31</timestamp>
<p>- <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>
- <subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh, Cuddlywhiskers,
I don't know what to say.
</p><timestamp>00:18:36</timestamp>
<p>Well, then why don't you just say,
"Whassup, bitches?"
</p><timestamp>00:18:39</timestamp>
<p>But, you know, not that.
</p><timestamp>00:18:41</timestamp>
<p>- Something like that.
- We'll figure it out.
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p>Seriously, can I hear 400 dollars?
Let's not forget why we're here tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:18:50</timestamp>
<p>To raise money
for the John Edwards campaign.
</p><timestamp>00:18:53</timestamp>
<p>I was talking
to one of the volunteers earlier
and she was just gushing
about how John Edwards touched her.
</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>I say, let's make this man president
so he can touch whoever he wants.
</p><timestamp>00:19:02</timestamp>
<p>- Four hundred dollars.
- I don't know what's cheesier,
this three-cheese risotto
or that dude's patter.
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p>Seriously.
</p><timestamp>00:19:08</timestamp>
<p>This fundraiser should have a fundraiser
for a better host of this fundraiser.
</p><timestamp>00:19:13</timestamp>
<p>Totes McGotes.
</p><timestamp>00:19:14</timestamp>
<p>I'll post that to my Twitter page.

<p>Todd, so we've been together
for months now.
</p><timestamp>00:19:38</timestamp>
<p>Um, I was thinking maybe that we try sex?
</p><timestamp>00:19:42</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:19:43</timestamp>
<p>We don't have to.
I don't wanna peer pressure you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:46</timestamp>
<p>No. I'm ready for sexual situations.
</p><timestamp>00:19:50</timestamp>
<p>- Um...
- Hooray. Um, taking your virginity.
</p><timestamp>00:19:54</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, sure. That's how I would say it.
</p><timestamp>00:19:55</timestamp>
<p>Okay, here we-- Here I go.
Uh, this is Todd doing sex.

</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>Oh, snap. My dad's home early.
You gotta get out of here.
</p><timestamp>00:20:07</timestamp>
<p>Your dad, the mobster?
</p><timestamp>00:20:08</timestamp>
<p>What? My dad's not a mobster.
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p>You said he was like that guy
from <i>The Sopranos.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:12</timestamp>
<p>I said he works on <i>The Sopranos</i>.
He's an editor.
</p><timestamp>00:20:15</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God, oh, God! Even worse.
</p><timestamp>00:20:17</timestamp>
<p>He must be so desensitized to violence
and nihilistic ruminations
on the banality of evil.
</p><timestamp>00:20:23</timestamp>
<p>Here, out the window.
You love shimmying, right?
</p><timestamp>00:20:25</timestamp>
<p>You know I love shimmying,
but that's a two-story drop.
</p><timestamp>00:20:29</timestamp>
<p>Use this.
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>- Go, get out. Go, go!

<p>- Hold that thought.

</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Princess Carolyn, you came.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>I figured since I'm your agent, I should
at least show up to your premiere party.
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>I know I haven't called in a while.
I've been really busy.
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>I figured you'd call me
if you needed a coffee.
</p><timestamp>00:21:09</timestamp>
<p>Ouch.
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>Hey, big premiere tonight.
Very exciting.
</p><timestamp>00:21:13</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>After tonight, it's no more "Aren't you
the horse from <i>Horsin' Around?"</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>From now on it'll be,
"You're BoJack Horseman."
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>I'm happy for you, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>- How about a kiss for good luck?
- No, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p>I'm your agent and your friend,
and I will always support you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>But I'm 33 years old, and I want
to have a family by the time I'm 40.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to spend the next seven years
in and out of love with you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p>I've wasted too much time
waiting for things to happen.
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>And I'm not gonna wait anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>And for what it's worth, I always liked
the horse from <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>- You did?
- Yeah. Everybody did.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>Unbelievable.
Un-Jessica-Bielievable.
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>Can we not fight while I'm at a gig?
</p><timestamp>00:21:57</timestamp>
<p>There are a lot of big producers,
this could be my next big break.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
This podunk benefit is below us.
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>I'm about to be in what I've been told
is a very important gay rights movie,
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p><i>I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>I now pronounce me very impressed,
but I'm not getting those kinds of offers.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>- As Justin would say, "Cry me a river."
- Hey, if you like Justin so much,
maybe you should just continue
to be really good friends with him.
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>Fine, maybe I will marry Justin.
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>Uh, I didn't say that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>I now pronounce this marriage over.
Biel with it.
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sobbing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:30</timestamp>
<p>- You wanted water?
- Thanks.
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>Wait. Blarn, right?
Yeah, from the coffee shop.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>What are you doing here?
Is there coffee to "bariste"?
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>I also do cater waiter gigs
to make ends meet.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>You "bariste" and cater <i>and</i> waiter?
<subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Triple threat.
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>
<p>I should be bringing you the water.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>You know, just for the record, I think
it's cool that you put yourself out there.
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p>A lot of guys in your position
wouldn't take gigs like this.
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>They'd be afraid people
would make fun of them.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>That's dumb.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>If you care about what other people think,
you're never gonna do anything.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>- Yeah, you're right.
- Oh, my God, I'm so glad you agree.
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>I was like, "Why did I say that?
That was so dumb."
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>Then you were like, "That's right."
And I was like, "Ooh! Validation."
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>- Hey, mind if I change out of this shirt?
- Go ahead.
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle> This monkey suit is killing me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:17</timestamp>
<p>Oof! Hey there, Delilah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>Sweet hang, Blarn.
You're one in a million.
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>- Actually, my name isn't Blarn.
- What?
</p><timestamp>00:23:26</timestamp>
<p>I put that on my nametag as a dumb joke
to subvert the idea
of co-opting personal identity
to further corporate branding which,
as I'm saying it, isn't much of a joke.
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:36</timestamp>
<p>"Blarn." That is very funny.
You should be a writer.
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p>Thanks. I'm Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>- Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Yeah, I know.
</p><timestamp>00:23:44</timestamp>
<p>- Add me on MySpace, okay?
- Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>All right.
Guess I'll see you around, Diana.
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>It's Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:23:53</timestamp>
<p>Hey, buddy, slight change of plans.
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>Call it off.
Call the whole thing off.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>What do you mean?
We premiere in two minutes.
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>Call the network,
cancel the whole thing.
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>Nobody wants to see me take a dump
on a <i>Horsin' Around</i> VHS.
</p><timestamp>00:24:04</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, it's going to be fine.
This is what we wanted, remember?
</p><timestamp>00:24:08</timestamp>
<p>Easy for you to say.
It's my name on the show.
</p><timestamp>00:24:11</timestamp>
<p>This is why I didn't want to do
another TV show. Everything was perfect.
</p><timestamp>00:24:14</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, this shit is bananas.
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.
</p><timestamp>00:24:17</timestamp>
<p>I can't promise everyone
will love this show.
</p><timestamp>00:24:20</timestamp>
<p>No matter what, people will remember it.
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>Five, ten years from now, this is the show
people will associate you with,
and you'll be glad they do.
</p><timestamp>00:24:27</timestamp>
<p>Because this show is real,
it's edgy, it's different.
</p><timestamp>00:24:30</timestamp>
<p>A lesser talent
couldn't have pulled it off.
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>But I'm willing to bet
on BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:24:35</timestamp>
<p>- Are you?
- Yes, I am.
</p><timestamp>00:24:37</timestamp>
<p>Great. Because the show is starting
and your life is about to change forever,
in three, two, one.
