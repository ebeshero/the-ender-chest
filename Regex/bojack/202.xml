<p>So, at the end of the day,
</p><timestamp>00:00:12</timestamp>
<p>I'm just a regular guy trying
to live a regular life.
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>Remember that time you peed
in Drew Barrymore's car?
</p><timestamp>00:00:18</timestamp>
<p>Uh, yes, I remember that.
Why do you remember that?
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>It was in your book.
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>-You should do that to someone here.
-What? No.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>Well, anyway, I can't believe
I'm on a date with BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>I feel like that anonymous girl
from Chapter 8 of your book
mixed with the pluck and determination
of that anonymous girl
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>-from Chapter 12.
-We don't need to dwell on the past.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>Wait, shut up.
Is this the restaurant you bought
when you were trying
to show up Mr. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>-Uh... No.
-Hey, this table's a little wobbly.
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>Want to yell at the waiter
and make a scene?
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>-No, I don't need--
-Come on, do that BoJack thing
where you make a big deal
and everyone laughs,
but at the same time we relate,
because you're saying
the things polite society won't.
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>That's not-- Ugh...
</p><timestamp>00:00:59</timestamp>
<p>-Is everything all right over here?
-No, everything is not all right.
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>This table's been wobbling all evening.
</p><timestamp>00:01:05</timestamp>
<p>If I wanted to flop around and get seasick
for an hour, I'd call your mother.
</p><timestamp>00:01:09</timestamp>
<p>-Something in that area or...?
-Take me home now
and don't let me get out of bed
until I turn horse-colored.
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>-What are you doing?
-Did you want me to stay?
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p>No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.
</p><timestamp>00:01:21</timestamp>
<p>Some of us here are trying
to forget you exist.
</p><timestamp>00:01:23</timestamp>
<p>"Forget you exist."
Classic BoJack. Love it.
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Claire</subtitle> Oh, my God, are you Todd?
<subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Uh, yes.
</p><timestamp>00:01:30</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Claire</subtitle> "Shut up, Todd!"
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Claire laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Aw, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:01:36</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>♪♪</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:33</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Todd, can you drive me
to get my car?
</p><timestamp>00:02:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I wanted to be responsible last night,
so I Ubered home
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>-and left my car in the fountain.
-Sorry, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:02:41</timestamp>
<p>I gotta get ready for my grand opening.
It's finally happening. My Disneyland.
</p><timestamp>00:02:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I realize that by saying "what"
I might set off a chain of events
</p><timestamp>00:02:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}whereby we continue this conversation,
but what?
</p><timestamp>00:02:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, remember when I first moved in
and I kept asking
</p><timestamp>00:02:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-if we could go to Disneyland?
-I do not.
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And then you said
that there was no Disneyland.
</p><timestamp>00:02:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-No.
-That Disneyland was a made-up lie,
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}like the tooth fairy, that parents use
to get their kids to behave.
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Oh, yeah, that shut you up.
-Sure did.
</p><timestamp>00:03:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But then I thought,
why isn't there a Disneyland?
</p><timestamp>00:03:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}People would love it!
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So, I took matters into my own hands,
</p><timestamp>00:03:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and over the last five years,
I built my own Disneyland.
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You've been doing this for five years?
How have you never mentioned it?
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I bought that cheap plot of non-arable
dirt by the toxic waste dump
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-up the hill from the old fire station.
-Okay, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:03:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I'm gonna build a Disneyland.
-Sounds great, champ.
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}If it wasn't for that,
she never would've gotten sober.
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Just finished drawing up blueprints
for that Disneyland I'm building.
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Kind of busy here, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So, it turned out to be a good thing
I peed in her car.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sorry for all the noise.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Got this crew of worker bees
to help me build my Disneyland.
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Okay, I get it. You are building
your own Disneyland.
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Literally the first I'm hearing of this.
-Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.
</p><timestamp>00:03:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Finally, people will have a place to go
after they win the Super Bowl.
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But you do know
that there already is a Disneyland?
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Yeah, I built it.
-No, I mean the real Disneyland.
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You mean, the one in the hearts
and minds of children everywhere?
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-The one in Anaheim!
-I think we're saying the same thing.
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>Are we?
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>
<p>Well, I think it's safe
to take the cone off.
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>I can do it for a small co-pay.
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>Can't say I'll miss it,
but we did have some crazy adventures
together these last few weeks.
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>Honey, would you rub my chin for me
so I can remember things?
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>Oh, um, okay. Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, memories.
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>Hey, where should we go for my first meal
after the operation?
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>It's not an operation,
but we could go to Storky's again.
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah! We're finally due
for our free sub.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>"Storky's,
where your 81st sandwich is free."
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>We've been there 80 times?
It just opened last month.
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but you love it, so whenever
you suggest it, I always say yes.
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but 80 times?
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>Well, that'll be $6000.
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>Good thing you're getting
a free sandwich, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>What the...?
</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p>Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>Okay, you guys. <subtitle>yells</subtitle>
You vultures are killing me!
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure he's talking about
other vultures.
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>Ah, the Valley.
</p><timestamp>00:05:27</timestamp>
<p>Because sometimes you wanna go
where no one knows your name.
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Pinky</subtitle> BoJack Horseman!
-Pinky? Hey, how are you?
</p><timestamp>00:05:34</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>stammers</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>Oh, great!
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>-How's the book biz?
-Who knows?
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>I jumped off that burning ship.
Print media? What a joke.
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>Now I got a job
in broadcast network television,
a booming industry
with nowhere to go but up.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>-What are you doing here?
-Oh, my boss loves this place.
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>Do you know Wanda Pierce?
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>Wanda just got named head
of programming at MBN.
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>We're here to celebrate.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>Well, that and she just woke up
from a 30-year coma.
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>Wait, she just got out
of a 30-year coma
and she's the head of programming
at a major broadcast network?
</p><timestamp>00:06:10</timestamp>
<p>She's been with the company 30 years.
Everyone above her kept getting fired.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>Besides, she's got
some really fresh ideas.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>I am really feeling
<i>The Kirk Cameron Show.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p>I don't even need a pilot.
Let's just order 22 episodes.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>How about a new show
where celebrities try to guess
whether or not people have talent?
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>We'll air it three nights a week.
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>Okay, what if we got relevant superstar
David Copperfield
to make
the World Trade Center disappear?
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>I hate to be the one to tell you this,
but David Copperfield really isn't
a big draw anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>Actually, everything feels fresh
if you just forget
the last 30 years ever happened.
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>woman over PA</subtitle>
<i>And here's a special request.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p><i>I've never even heard of this song,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p><i>but let's give it a spin:</i>
<i>"Special Feeling."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>Wanda, meet
the one and only BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>-Who?
-BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>-Who?
-BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>Is that name supposed
to mean something to me?
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>light rock ballad playing over speakers</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>-Do you want to go skate?
-Nah. You know what they say,
you can lead a horse to roller,
but you can't make him rink.
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:21</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-That's really funny.
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>-You're funny.
-Really?
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God. You should be on TV,
</p><timestamp>00:07:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
which, holy shit, they're flat now.
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>Actually, I was on. You know what,
I'm sick of talking about me.
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>Let's talk about you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Wanda</subtitle> Next thing I know,
I'm waking up from a 30-year coma.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch,
but it's not ideal.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>She's molting.
You know how sisters are.
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here
with the regulars.
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>How hard is it to look
before they bring it out?
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>-Excuse me, miss?
-I know, isn't it cool?
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>-Like we're getting away with something.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p>Don't you love it when appetizers have
a little crossover episode?
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>It's like when you're watching
<i>Happy Days </i>and Mork shows up.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah, I guess.
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>Or like when Kramer was
on <i>Murphy Brown</i>.
</p><timestamp>00:08:11</timestamp>
<p>-Who?
-Hey, you want to get out of here?
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>I don't want MBN to just be another boring
old network, you know what I mean?
</p><timestamp>00:08:22</timestamp>
<p>-Yes, totally.
-I want to take risks.
</p><timestamp>00:08:24</timestamp>
<p>I want to swing for the fences, you know?
Otherwise, what are we doing?
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, is it morning?
We stayed up all night talking,
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>-and we didn't even have sex.
-Well, it's not too late.
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>-That was fantastic.
-Oh, yes.
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years.
I hope.
</p><timestamp>00:08:46</timestamp>
<p>-Something's wrong.
-What is it?
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>I don't know, I feel weird, like I want
to spend more time with you
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>-even though I know we just had sex.
-Oh, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>No, you don't understand.
</p><timestamp>00:08:55</timestamp>
<p>We already had sex,
but I still want to spend time with you.
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p>Is that normal? Am I normal?
What is happening to me?
</p><timestamp>00:09:03</timestamp>
<p>We can spend more time together.
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>I want to do things with you.
Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-I don't understand these feelings.
</p><timestamp>00:09:12</timestamp>
<p>Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or--
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God, it's coming. I can't stop it.
</p><timestamp>00:09:19</timestamp>
<p>-Do you want to go to Disneyland?
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:09:26</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>carnival music playing over speakers</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:31</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>child crying</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires
and loose nails than I remember.
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>Please hold your questions
until the end of the tour.
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>Here we have
Mr. Todd's Wild Death-Coaster.
</p><timestamp>00:09:45</timestamp>
<p>The name is a work in progress,
but we wanted to work "death"
into the title for liability reasons.
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p>And this is Gabe Jr.,
the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>-This is boring. I want to go home.
-Vincent, be nice!
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>He's a little cranky
because he just got adult braces.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>-You mean, braces.
-Princess Carolyn, stop embarrassing me!
</p><timestamp>00:10:07</timestamp>
<p>Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>And here we have Cinderella's
magical pile of used mattresses.
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>child</subtitle> Help!
</p><timestamp>00:10:15</timestamp>
<p>Is it a good idea
to keep all those mattresses
</p><timestamp>00:10:17</timestamp>
<p>-so close to an active grease fire?
-Where's your sense of wonder, Diane?
</p><timestamp>00:10:21</timestamp>
<p>-Your friend is really negative.
-Yeah, don't be so negative, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-You know I hate negativity.
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I don't hate it because
that's also negative, but you know.
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>quacks, then yells</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>children laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
-Hey, buddy. This place is amazing.
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p>It's like some sort of Disney version
of Knott's Berry Farm.
</p><timestamp>00:10:42</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's exactly
what I was going for!
</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>
<p>I can't wait to get involved
and really spray the old
Mr. Peanutbutter scent on everything.
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>Uh, I was sort of thinking of this
as kind of just my thing.
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>Well, technically, you did build this
while working for P.B. Livin,
so I have the blah-blah-blah
of first refusal or whatever.
</p><timestamp>00:11:03</timestamp>
<p>Oh, uh, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:11:04</timestamp>
<p>I mean, that's just good business.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>We're in this together now, Todd,
and nothing will distract me from--
</p><timestamp>00:11:10</timestamp>
<p>Erica! You can't be here.
This place is filled with children.
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p>Coach said he saw you headed
to the visitor's locker room
with a steel pipe.
</p><timestamp>00:11:20</timestamp>
<p>You really think I'm the guy
who busted that pinto's leg?
</p><timestamp>00:11:23</timestamp>
<p>'Cause if I am, you should be
a lot more goddamn scared of me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>Hey! My girlfriend's here.
Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend!
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>Sure. We'll cut there.
</p><timestamp>00:11:33</timestamp>
<p>The middle of your line
is as good a place as any.
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>-What are you doing here?
-Just wanted to stop by.
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>We're filming <i>Hey, I Think</i>
<i>You Can Dance! </i>next door.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>Look at you, all professional.
</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p>Like Natalie Portman in that movie
where she was a professional.
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>Who? <subtitle>giggles</subtitle>
People are watching.
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>The first time BoJack dates a woman
his own age,
she's basically just
a stunted 20-year-old.
</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>Well, BoJack's stunted, too.
He got famous in his twenties,
so he'll be

<p>After you get famous, you stop growing,
you don't have to.
</p><timestamp>00:12:01</timestamp>
<p>Every celebrity has
an age of stagnation.
</p><timestamp>00:12:04</timestamp>
<p>I'm glad I never got famous.
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I did write a best-selling book,
but I'm not famous-famous.
</p><timestamp>00:12:08</timestamp>
<p>It doesn't just happen
when you get famous.
</p><timestamp>00:12:10</timestamp>
<p>Your age of stagnation
is when you stop growing.
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>For most, it's when they get married,
settle into a routine.
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>You meet someone
who loves you unconditionally
and never challenges you
or wants you to change,
and then you never change.
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p>But mostly it's just the famous people,
right?

<p>I wanted to make you feel at home,
and nothing was bigger in the '80s
than '50s nostalgia.
</p><timestamp>00:12:42</timestamp>
<p>It really feels like I'm back in the '80s,
feeling like I'm back in the '50s.

<p>Wanda, these last few days
have been so amazing.
</p><timestamp>00:13:12</timestamp>
<p>You've given me a fresh start.
</p><timestamp>00:13:14</timestamp>
<p>In fact, it almost feels like
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up
from a 30-year coma?
</p><timestamp>00:13:21</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, no, not me. Her.
-That's insane.

</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>It's been really tough for me
these last few weeks.
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>I've never seen <i>Home Alone </i>and everyone
makes me feel like a freak because of it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:48</timestamp>
<p>-You've never seen <i>Home Alone?</i>
-I've never seen it!
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>-Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.
-Neither do I!
</p><timestamp>00:13:54</timestamp>
<p>-No one does. It's just a magic box.
-Wanda, we have so much in common.
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>Really it's just one thing.
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>You can't count each individual thing
as a different thing.
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>That's like saying I have a lot
in common with Kanye West

</p><timestamp>00:14:27</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I'm starting to lose
the thread of your character.
</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p>You think you can drop the jealous
boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.
</p><timestamp>00:14:34</timestamp>
<p>You're right, I'm sorry.
Call me Snoop Dogg
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>-because I will drop it like it's hot.
-BoJack, I don't--
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>I got that one! Snoopy the dog.
From "Peanuts." Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:14:49</timestamp>
<p>I got here as fast as I could.
</p><timestamp>00:14:51</timestamp>
<p>Where's this next Haley Joel Osment?
</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>-That was a lie to get you here.
-Aw, fish.
</p><timestamp>00:14:56</timestamp>
<p>-There's never a next Haley Joel Osment.
-And there never will be.
</p><timestamp>00:14:59</timestamp>
<p>Sorry I tricked you, but with Todd
running his own Disneyland
and actress Margo Martindale
in prison
for some reason I don't remember,
you're the best friend I've got.
</p><timestamp>00:15:07</timestamp>
<p>Now grab the binoculars. I need dirt
on Wanda's new gentleman friend.
</p><timestamp>00:15:11</timestamp>
<p>No, BoJack. What's the play here?
</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>
<p>You'll find one little imperfection
and harp on it
like you do with my boyfriend?
</p><timestamp>00:15:17</timestamp>
<p>You do understand what my "thing" is
with your boyfriend?
</p><timestamp>00:15:20</timestamp>
<p>You'll just push her
into this other guy's arms.
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>

<p><i>This is Comrade Alexander</i>

<p>It's been two weeks since I woke up,
and I still have not been contacted
by my handlers.
</p><timestamp>00:15:35</timestamp>
<p>I am awaiting orders to take down
the American dogs and pigs
and other various animals and humans.
Come in, KGB High Command.
</p><timestamp>00:15:42</timestamp>
<p>Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>Hey, what's going on here?
</p><timestamp>00:15:52</timestamp>
<p>You've been served
with a cease-and-desist from my clients,
the Walt Disney Company.
</p><timestamp>00:15:57</timestamp>
<p>I wanted to make sure what we were
doing here was 100 percent legal,
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p>-so I called a lawyer.
-Wait, what?
</p><timestamp>00:16:03</timestamp>
<p>As it turns out, it's not legal at all.
Who knew?
</p><timestamp>00:16:06</timestamp>
<p>-Mr. Peanutbutter.
-We'll see you in court.
</p><timestamp>00:16:10</timestamp>
<p>-The food court?
-No. Regular court.
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>
<p>Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I might
just stop by the food court first.
</p><timestamp>00:16:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Let the record show, this is the single
dumbest case I've ever adjudicated.
</p><timestamp>00:16:25</timestamp>
<p>-Mr. Chavez?
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:16:28</timestamp>
<p>I'm just gonna throw this out there.
</p><timestamp>00:16:29</timestamp>
<p>Is it possible maybe when the other guys
tried to copyright the name Disneyland,
they wrote down something else
by mistake,
so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs?
</p><timestamp>00:16:39</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, let's have a look
at the Articles of Incorporation to see
if Walt Disney accidentally trademarked
the wrong name. I'm sure these--
</p><timestamp>00:16:49</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>stammers</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-There's a typo. Di-isneyland.
</p><timestamp>00:16:54</timestamp>
<p>With two "i"s. That son of a gun
trademarked the wrong name.
</p><timestamp>00:16:59</timestamp>
<p>May I, counselor?
</p><timestamp>00:17:01</timestamp>
<p>D-I-I-S.
This is unambiguous.
</p><timestamp>00:17:04</timestamp>
<p>-I find in favor of the defendant.
-Aw, shit.
</p><timestamp>00:17:08</timestamp>
<p>-You're the defendant.
-Aw, sweet!
</p><timestamp>00:17:11</timestamp>
<p>Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriage
of justice.
</p><timestamp>00:17:15</timestamp>
<p>Hooray! Gross miscarriage!
</p><timestamp>00:17:21</timestamp>
<p>And that's how I turned my dream into
what I call "The Happiest Place On Urf."
</p><timestamp>00:17:27</timestamp>
<p>Urf is a made-up magical kingdom
I added to the Disney canon.
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>-Americans, they like this theme park?
-Oh, they love it.
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>It represents everything
America stands for.
</p><timestamp>00:17:36</timestamp>
<p><i>Da.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>-I mean, yeah.
-We did it, buddy!
</p><timestamp>00:17:40</timestamp>
<p>Actually, I did it.
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>I had the idea to build a park,
I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.
</p><timestamp>00:17:49</timestamp>
<p>-Well, there's no "i" in "team," right?
-But there is an "i" in "Disneyland."
</p><timestamp>00:17:54</timestamp>
<p>And unlike that other Disneyland,
this Disneyland only has one "i".
</p><timestamp>00:18:00</timestamp>
<p>What are you saying?
</p><timestamp>00:18:01</timestamp>
<p>You're not welcome
at my theme park anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:18:04</timestamp>
<p>There's only room for one goofy dog there
and his name is Pluto.
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>Todd, no.
</p><timestamp>00:18:11</timestamp>
<p>I've told the bees
if they see you to sting you on sight.
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>You understand. It's nothing personal.
It's just good business.
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>And that's how we do business on Urf.
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p>-I don't like you like this.
-I learned it from you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:26</timestamp>
<p>If I could get everyone's attention.
</p><timestamp>00:18:28</timestamp>
<p>You're probably wondering
why I invited you all here tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:18:31</timestamp>
<p>You said it was to celebrate
Todd's legal victory.
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>Right, but obviously,
I don't care about that,
so you're probably wondering
the real reason.
</p><timestamp>00:18:38</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Princess Carolyn</subtitle>
No, we just took you at face value.
</p><timestamp>00:18:41</timestamp>
<p>We have a special guest here tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:18:43</timestamp>
<p>Alex. Or should I say "comrade"?
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:48</timestamp>
<p>-Why would you say "comrade"?
-Oh, I forgot to explain that part.
</p><timestamp>00:18:52</timestamp>
<p>Alex is a KGB agent
bent on destroying America.
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:57</timestamp>
<p>-It truly is a small world after all!
-Alex, is that true?
</p><timestamp>00:19:00</timestamp>
<p>Okay, yes. It's true.
</p><timestamp>00:19:03</timestamp>
<p>I was a deep-cover KGB operative
before I went into my coma.
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p>I've been trying to contact
my handler in Russia,
but I can't reach him
and I don't know if I ever will.
</p><timestamp>00:19:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all</subtitle> Aww!
</p><timestamp>00:19:13</timestamp>
<p>No! He's-- It's not adorable!
</p><timestamp>00:19:16</timestamp>
<p>He's a soviet sleeper-agent
who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.
</p><timestamp>00:19:20</timestamp>
<p>I felt totally alone in this world
before I met Wanda.
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p>And then I met all of you, my friends.
</p><timestamp>00:19:25</timestamp>
<p>But if you're gonna kick me to the curb
just because I think
you're all capitalist swine
and want to see your way
of life destroyed, well, so be it.
</p><timestamp>00:19:33</timestamp>
<p>-Or should I say, So-vi-et.
-Oh! Cute. Wordplay.
</p><timestamp>00:19:38</timestamp>
<p>-That's not even good wordplay.
-Wait, how did you know all this?
</p><timestamp>00:19:41</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack, were you spying on him?
-He is literally a spy
trying to destroy America,
the country we all live in.
</p><timestamp>00:19:48</timestamp>
<p>How am I the bad guy here?
</p><timestamp>00:19:49</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I am really bumping on
the whole you-not-liking-Alex of it all.
</p><timestamp>00:19:54</timestamp>
<p>-You told me you were going to drop it.
-Yeah, but--
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>I don't care about Alex.
</p><timestamp>00:19:58</timestamp>
<p>I want to know what happened
to the amazing guy
</p><timestamp>00:20:00</timestamp>
<p>I spent the last few days with,
because if this is who you are,
</p><timestamp>00:20:04</timestamp>
<p>I don't think I like it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:05</timestamp>
<p>Alex, would you take me back
to my sister's place?
</p><timestamp>00:20:07</timestamp>
<p>Sure thing, Wanda.
And I can get you there fast
because I'm always Russian.
</p><timestamp>00:20:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all</subtitle> Aww!
</p><timestamp>00:20:13</timestamp>
<p>Seriously?

<p><subtitle>BoJack sighs</subtitle>
<subtitle>Princess Carolyn gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:20</timestamp>

Where's the next Dakota Fa--?
</p><timestamp>00:20:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I get what happened.
</p><timestamp>00:20:25</timestamp>
<p>Could you get me a beer from the fridge?
I didn't want to stand up.
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>Wait, no. I don't deserve beer.
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p>You called me all the way over here
to not get you a beer?
</p><timestamp>00:20:33</timestamp>
<p>Why do I always do this?
I push away everyone I care about.
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>Oh, do you? I never noticed that.
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>Look, you obviously really care
about this girl
and that scares you,
so you sabotage yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:20:44</timestamp>
<p>That's my problem.
I'm too good at sabotage.
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>-Why am I so good at everything I do?
-Hey, I got a crazy idea.
</p><timestamp>00:20:51</timestamp>
<p>How about you just stop sulking
and go win her back, dummy?
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>You're right. I gotta win her back,
put it all on the line. You know what?
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>I think I will have that beer,
can you get it for me?
</p><timestamp>00:21:01</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>-Why do I bother?

</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>Actually, I want both beers!
</p><timestamp>00:21:13</timestamp>
<p>-Wanda.
-What do you want, BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>There's something I gotta say.
When I was--
</p><timestamp>00:21:18</timestamp>
<p>-Todd! There's something I gotta say!
-Hey, I'm kind of already doing--
</p><timestamp>00:21:21</timestamp>
<p>I never should have tried
to make your thing my thing!
</p><timestamp>00:21:24</timestamp>
<p>I just got excited and wanted to smear
Mr. Peanutbutter all over everything.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>I should have been supporting you,
like this support beam.
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>-Or a different support beam.
-It's my fault.
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>The point of Disneyland isn't
to make money and win lawsuits.
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p>But I forgot that.
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>So, these two were so consumed
by greed that it destroyed them.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>You know, I came here today
to blow up Disneyland.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>-You what?
-But now I realize,
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>I don't need to take down capitalism.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>Capitalism sows the seeds

<p>No, no, no! Listen.

</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>
<p>-But the fire.

</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p>Look, the great guy you've been
getting to know, that's me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p>That other guy,
the guy from the party,
that's me too and you need
to know that. I'm not perfect.
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>I'm cynical and I'm possessive
and I can sometimes fly off the handle.
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm not always the best

</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p>I gotta say,
I'm not loving this pitch so far.
</p><timestamp>00:23:07</timestamp>
<p>But I want to be better,
I'm trying to be better.
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>And when I'm around you,

<p>Wow. That's a great line.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>-Did you just come up with that?
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>Hey, boys and girls,
this is your park DJ speaking.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>And as the <i>Titanic's </i>band played on
as the ship sank,
so too will I spin one last record
as my DJ booth is engulfed in flames.

<p>Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:24:05</timestamp>
<p>-You saved me!
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>I saved us.
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>Woo-hoo!
</p><timestamp>00:24:13</timestamp>
<p>-I want to give this a real shot.
-I don't know, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:24:16</timestamp>
<p>I just got out of my coma,
and I don't have time to waste
if you're still figuring your shit out.
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>Plus, it's hard to think straight
with this fire everywhere.
</p><timestamp>00:24:24</timestamp>
<p>-Move in with me.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:24:26</timestamp>
<p>I know it feels fast.
We barely know each other.
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p>It's crazy, but I like you.
</p><timestamp>00:24:31</timestamp>
<p>And sometimes you gotta swing
for the fences, right?
</p><timestamp>00:24:34</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:24:36</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Let's move in together.
Let's do it.
</p><timestamp>00:24:39</timestamp>
<p>It's crazy, but let's do it!
