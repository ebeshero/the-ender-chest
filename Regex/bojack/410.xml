<p>Nothing gets by me, Tina.

<p>-<subtitle>mutters</subtitle>
-I don't think you have any blues.
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>I think you put the wild card down,
and chose blue,
because you want us
to think you have blues.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>-Just go already!
-Uh, excuse me.
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>I am employing
a little something called "strategy."
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>I am taking my time because
I enjoy being the center of attention.
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>

you have to listen.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>It's been your turn
for ten minutes.
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>Well, since you're being so impatient,
</p><timestamp>00:00:40</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna put my thing down,
flip it and reverse it back to Tina.

<p>I'm fine! I just-- Ow!
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p>Did you cut yourself?
It's okay. I know what to do.
</p><timestamp>00:01:09</timestamp>
<p>You need some alcohol, ice,
a squeeze of lemon.
</p><timestamp>00:01:12</timestamp>

<p>{\an8}-Ha! Just what I expected.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>Before Woodchuck,</i>
<i>the hands belonged to one</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>Ernest Contralto, a criminal.</i>
<i>The man was a pedophile murderer.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>
<p><i>Well, if you gotta murder somebody...</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p><i>No, Tom. Not a pedophile-dash-murderer.</i>
<i>A pedophile-slash-murderer!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p><i>Oh, no! The way you said "slash"</i>
<i>was very scary!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p><i>At first I didn't like him,</i>
<i>on account, uh... he didn't have hands?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p><i>But then he got new hands,</i>
<i>so I liked him again?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p><i>But then I found out those hands are bad!</i>
<i>Can't trust politicians.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>She's killing us on this hands thing.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Much like Ernest Contralto
killed those innocent children
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}after he pedophiled them,
with those very hands.
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>Not helping!
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>Your hands are being
really aggressive right now.

</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>Hey, girl, whatcha working on?
Getting some clicks?
</p><timestamp>00:04:35</timestamp>
<p>Get them clicks, girl.
Get. Them. Clicks.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm working on another big piece
about how Jessica Biel is owned
</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}by private prison lobbyists, who want--
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my Gaia, Diane, nobody cares.
I care and I don't even care.
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>So imagine how little
someone who doesn't care cares.
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>-Well...
-What if you had lunch with her?
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Why would--
-You could write about
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}what she smells like,
how she makes her face pretty.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}These are things people will want
to know about our first female governor.
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>screeching</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>I'll have the avocado toast.
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But instead of the avocado part,
I want fresh sea air,
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and instead of the toast,
I'll have a single grain of rice.
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-And for you?
-Grilled cheese?
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>Thank you for meeting me here, Diane.
I just wanted to tell you,
you can keep writing
whatever you want about me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:24</timestamp>
<p>Obviously, it has no effect on the polls,
because the only thing voters care about
is stupid bullshit, so knock yourself out.
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>Well, today I just want to know
what you smell like.
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>It's actually my new fragrance:
"Bielist," by Jessica Biel.
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>-Your perfume's called "B"-list?
-"Bielist."
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>"B"-list. Like a "B"-list celebrity.
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p>-No, "Bielist" like Jessica Biel.
-I think we're saying the same thing.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Do you want some?
I got a whole trunk of this stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-No, thanks.
-You sure?
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Mr. Peanutbutter always loved
the way I smelled.
</p><timestamp>00:05:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, I wouldn't flatter
yourself too much.
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}He's very enthusiastic
about smelling in general.
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}He's enthusiastic about everything.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God. Does he still have
that dumb magic eye poster?
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>What? No.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>When we were married,
he was obsessed with it.
</p><timestamp>00:06:05</timestamp>
<p>And he would make me
stare at it for hours.
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I bet.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>But then, all of a sudden, I saw it.
And it was incredible.
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>And I was so happy
that I had waited long enough
to experience this beautiful thing,
and I felt so...
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>Why is this disgusting avocado
on my plate?
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, I...
-I feel personally attacked right now.
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, so sorry.
-<subtitle>retches</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>Anyway,
as I was saying about the poster,
it's funny how something so stupid
could have this tremendous power.
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p>You know what I mean?
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I think I do.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p><i>A blog post about Jessica Biel</i>

<p>Wow. Who'da thunk
that such a small trivial detail

</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, who'da thunk it?
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>Who knew?
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>I knew. I put the avocado thing
in the story on purpose,
</p><timestamp>00:07:27</timestamp>
<p>I knew people wouldn't like it.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>So just for the record, I "thunk" it.
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>Even though it doesn't matter.
I don't need credit.
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>But it does, if I didn't do that,
it wouldn't have happened.
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>

from several concerned parents.
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p>It seems that many
of your clown dentists
aren't actually licensed
to practice medicine.
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p>Isn't laughter the <i>best</i> medicine?
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>No. It is the worst medicine.
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>If you can even call it medicine,
which, legally, you cannot.
</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>
<p>Well, what if I said my business
was for entertainment purposes?
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>That would require your employees
to be entertaining.
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>According to your reviews on Yelp,
your clown dentists are, quote,
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>"A cotton candy nightmare of Freudian
invention that shakes one to the core."
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>Ah, everyone's a critic.
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>On Yelp? Yes, that is the idea.
</p><timestamp>00:09:02</timestamp>
<p>It appears your business provides
no service but to terrify children
and the adults who accompany them.
</p><timestamp>00:09:06</timestamp>
<p>If this were October,
you could market your venture
as some sort of spooky
Halloween experience,
but since this is January,
a month which, to my knowledge,
contains no Halloweens,
I have no choice but to--
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>Wait! Wait.
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>What if my clown dentists
put on a show?
</p><timestamp>00:09:20</timestamp>
<p>A delightful, whimsical,
non-terrifying clown-stravaganza?
</p><timestamp>00:09:26</timestamp>
<p>You would have to agree
we were a legitimate
business then, right?
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>-Go on.
-Give us a week. We'll put on a show.
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>If you don't laugh,
I'll dissolve the business
and release all my clown dentists
into the woods,
where they'll never bother anyone again.
</p><timestamp>00:09:41</timestamp>
<p>All right.
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p>You have one week to create a show

</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>

-Judah, look at my phone! Judah!
</p><timestamp>00:10:48</timestamp>
<p>-You have a meeting with Flip McVicker.
-<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:51</timestamp>
<p>Tell his gal I'm running ten minutes late.
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>What gal?
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>-So, you're a writer?
-Oh, actually that's a typo.
</p><timestamp>00:11:02</timestamp>
<p>It should say "Waiter."
</p><timestamp>00:11:03</timestamp>
<p>-But I'm an aspiring writer.
-Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, that was a joke.
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>That's the kind of witty repartee
you can expect from--
</p><timestamp>00:11:10</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the business card.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>Wait, ya know,
</p><timestamp>00:11:13</timestamp>
<p>-I have this idea for a TV show.
-Oh?
</p><timestamp>00:11:15</timestamp>
<p>It's a grizzled former detective
who gets sucked back in--
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>This sounds fabulous.
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you write a script,
we'll go from there?
</p><timestamp>00:11:21</timestamp>
<p>-I already wrote it. Boom.
-Oh, you brought it with you.
</p><timestamp>00:11:24</timestamp>
<p>I don't trust email.
You know, the government.
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Look, Flip, before I even read this,
</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>I should tell you
that this town's a total crapshoot.
</p><timestamp>00:11:33</timestamp>
<p>Odds of the right person
finding your material
and connecting with it
are a million to... one.
</p><timestamp>00:11:39</timestamp>
<p>I just know I have this great potential
inside me. I know I can do it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p>Even if no one else understands
or believes in me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure that sounds pretty stupid but...
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>It's not stupid. I believe in you.
</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>I don't know how else to describe it
other than this feeling
of supreme warmth came over me,
like this is what I've been waiting for
my whole life.
</p><timestamp>00:12:01</timestamp>
<p>That's amazing!
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>Todd, the world is dark and scary
and full of creepy clown dentists...
</p><timestamp>00:12:06</timestamp>
<p>They're working very hard
to be less creepy.
</p><timestamp>00:12:08</timestamp>
<p>But when I hold this script in my hands,
I have hope.
</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>I gotta get this made.
What do I always say?
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>"What's the difference
between an agent and a manager?"
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>Uh, managers are always
talking about the differences
between agents and managers
and agents don't as much?
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>No! Managers can produce!
This script is a sign.
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>I gotta get off my ass
and produce this baby.
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>Todd? <subtitle>hiccups</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>Get me a meeting with Turtletaub.
Set something up with his gal.
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>Who is this gal?
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>

<p>We gotta help Princess Carolyn,
but also we gotta prep
for our big show next week.
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>If only there was a way
to do both at once.
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>What a ludicrous notion!
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>Doctor Picarello,
we might make a clown out of you yet!

<p>Uh, new perfume, "Sealist," by Seal.
</p><timestamp>00:14:02</timestamp>
<p>Now let's get to brass stacks.
</p><timestamp>00:14:05</timestamp>
<p>So it's a hot young writer.
It's TV. It's me producing.
</p><timestamp>00:14:09</timestamp>
<p>-"TV?"
-Just look at this script.
</p><timestamp>00:14:10</timestamp>
<p>I know it's gonna knock your socks off.
</p><timestamp>00:14:13</timestamp>
<p>Eh...
</p><timestamp>00:14:15</timestamp>
<p>Know that website,
"What-time-is-it-right-now-dot-com,"
you go to when you want
to know what time it is?
</p><timestamp>00:14:20</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>They look to make a play
in the gritty prestige streaming world,
and it could make a big splash
with a huge ad buy.
</p><timestamp>00:14:26</timestamp>
<p>Plus, you got the built-in audience
who don't know what time it is.
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p>That's huge! That's so many people!
</p><timestamp>00:14:31</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah, this could be perfect
as their first series,
but we'd have to get in fast.
</p><timestamp>00:14:34</timestamp>
<p>They wanna premiere
before Daylight Savings.
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>Let's set the pitch for next week.
</p><timestamp>00:14:38</timestamp>
<p><i>Philbert?</i> Who's Philbert?
</p><timestamp>00:14:40</timestamp>
<p>He's this grizzled

who gets sucked back in to something.
</p><timestamp>00:14:45</timestamp>
<p>No, I mean who <i>is </i>he?
</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>-You got a star attached?
-Not yet, but...
</p><timestamp>00:14:48</timestamp>
<p>Eh, we can't go in without a big name.
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>
<p>TV pitching is like the Israeli flag,
it's nothing without a big star.
</p><timestamp>00:14:53</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:14:55</timestamp>
<p>No! Fish!
</p><timestamp>00:14:57</timestamp>
<p>Oh, whoa... ooh, spinny.
</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>Uh-oh! She is out like sauerkraut.
</p><timestamp>00:15:03</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>mimics static</subtitle> Don't let Turtletaub
get back to his office.
</p><timestamp>00:15:07</timestamp>
<p>This sounds like a job
for the "Waltz of the Rubber Chicken"!

<p>-What the shell is this?

</p><timestamp>00:15:26</timestamp>

without saying anything at all.
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>You gotta be kidding me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:31</timestamp>
<p>Okay, okay, how about Aaron Eckhart?
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p>He owes me a favor
and he can disappear into any role.
</p><timestamp>00:15:35</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, he can disappear so good,
the audience disappears with him.
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>

<p>-Ben Mendelsohn.

<p>And then you get him playing
a rich, complex anti-hero like Philbert,
now there's a show that screams,
"What time is it right now?"
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.
</p><timestamp>00:16:34</timestamp>
<p>I'm saying, there are a lotta guys...
</p><timestamp>00:16:36</timestamp>
<p>P.C., can you get me BoJack or not?
</p><timestamp>00:16:37</timestamp>
<p>-Of course I can.
-I'll send over a contract, iron-clad.
</p><timestamp>00:16:41</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to risk that jerkwad
skipping town again.
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>
<p>-Make sure he signs it before the pitch.

<p>Guys, that was amazing!
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p>But if we're going to convince Yolanda
we're ready for the big top,
we need to really hunker down
over the next week

<p>-Hooray!

</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>...is what I <i>would</i> say
if you'd put on a good show.
</p><timestamp>00:17:21</timestamp>
<p>Just so you understand the rubric

<p>All right, you heard the lady.
Get into the car, everyone.

<p>-this afternoon at that clock website.

</p><timestamp>00:18:02</timestamp>
<p>Pretty sure it said "bitch" meeting
on the calendar.
</p><timestamp>00:18:05</timestamp>
<p>Seemed a little harsh.
I could go double-check,

</p><timestamp>00:19:01</timestamp>
<p>Is there more?
</p><timestamp>00:19:02</timestamp>
<p>I think there's a Lopez
in the mix somewhere?
</p><timestamp>00:19:04</timestamp>
<p>A Chung maybe?
</p><timestamp>00:19:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, sir, I can't help you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:08</timestamp>
<p>Okay, just... any information
you can give me
on the 17-year-old horse girl
who came here by ambulance
</p><timestamp>00:19:13</timestamp>
<p>15 minutes ago would be
of interest to my friend,
</p><timestamp>00:19:15</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Franklin's... friend, Mr. Hamilton.
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>
<p>If you can't prove you're
her parent or legal guardian,
</p><timestamp>00:19:20</timestamp>
<p>I can't release any information to you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:22</timestamp>
<p>-Guerrero!
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p>Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...
Robinson...
</p><timestamp>00:19:26</timestamp>
<p>Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack.
That's her name.
</p><timestamp>00:19:29</timestamp>
<p>And she's about five-eight.
</p><timestamp>00:19:30</timestamp>
<p>And she's 17,
her birthday is in September.
</p><timestamp>00:19:32</timestamp>
<p>And... she looks like me.
</p><timestamp>00:19:34</timestamp>
<p>And she loves apples
but hates apple sauce.
</p><timestamp>00:19:36</timestamp>
<p>And she's funny.
</p><timestamp>00:19:38</timestamp>
<p>But she isn't mean.
Which is pretty remarkable,
</p><timestamp>00:19:41</timestamp>
<p>'cause a lot of 17-year-olds think
you have to be mean to be funny,
but Hollyhock is very sweet,
even if she can be sarcastic.
</p><timestamp>00:19:48</timestamp>
<p>But she has this smile with...
</p><timestamp>00:19:52</timestamp>
<p>Does that help?
</p><timestamp>00:19:53</timestamp>
<p>No, man.
Are you her legal guardian?

</p><timestamp>00:20:25</timestamp>
<p>I'm the wrong Mannheim to mess with.
</p><timestamp>00:20:26</timestamp>
<p>I'm Dashawn Manheim.
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>I'm probably
the right Manheim to mess with,
unless we're talking about
a dance battle, in which case...
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>Five, six, seven, eight. Ha!
</p><timestamp>00:20:35</timestamp>
<p>-You've been warned.
-Okay. Yep.
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>Cupe Robinson III.
I think you're just ghastly,
and I was against
this whole caper from the bell.
</p><timestamp>00:20:43</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-Otto Zilberschlag.
</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>Uh, formerly a huge fan.
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>-Now... just a regular fan.
-Got it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>I know <i>of</i> you,
but not through your work.
</p><timestamp>00:20:51</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-I'm Gregory Hsung.
</p><timestamp>00:20:53</timestamp>
<p>I only watch foreign films.
That's my deal.
</p><timestamp>00:20:56</timestamp>
<p>Arturo Fonzarelli, but I'm pretty cool
so people call me the "Ice Man."
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>And I'm Quackers!
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>-Quack, quack, quack!

</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>How's Hollyhock?
They wouldn't give me information.
</p><timestamp>00:21:07</timestamp>
<p>-Why would they? You're not her dad.
-No, I know. I just... Is she okay?
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>She will be.
The doctor said she's lucky to be alive.
</p><timestamp>00:21:13</timestamp>
<p>What happened?
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>-She overdosed.
-What? No.
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>How could you let this happen?
Quack, quack!
</p><timestamp>00:21:18</timestamp>
<p>-Quackers! Settle down.
-What was she on? I had no idea.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>You had no idea?
</p><timestamp>00:21:23</timestamp>
<p>Have you looked at her?
She's as thin as a pole.
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p>You know I don't care
for your Polish jokes, Dashawn.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>She told us you were
taking care of her.
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>-I was.
-I knew she was too young
to be on her own like this.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>She's a child!
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>She called Pedro Almod√≥var's
<i>I'm So Excited</i> "excessively kitsch."
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>-Kitsch <i>is</i> excessive! That's the point!
-Can I see her? Can I talk to her?
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>-You're lucky we don't call the police!
-Quack, quack.
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>Our kid got hooked on amphetamines
because of you!
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>-No, I didn't...
-Quack, quack, quack, quack.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I feel like there's a lot
of male energy right now.
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>Why don't I come back in a couple hours?
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>Give Hollyhock a chance to rest
before I talk to her.
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>Are you insane?
You are never seeing Hollyhock again.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>-Look, if I could just...
-Never.

</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>Oh, Henrietta,
would you help me pack this?
</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>
<p>-I want to bring it to my son.
-Thanks, Mom.
</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p>-It's for my son.
-Right. How did I not see it?
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>All this time, I thought
you were a terrible parent.
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>And you were.
But I blew it even worse.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>It turns out being a parent is impossible,
so I guess I can't be that mad at you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>Mad at me? No, Henrietta,
this is the right thing. You'll see.
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>Maybe we deserve each other.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>Where is the girl?
I made the girl coffee.
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>Jesus, you two and your coffee.
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p>Wait. No.

<p>"Chub-B-Gone?"
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p>-Takes the pounds right off.
-This whole time.
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>Just until she learned to take it herself.
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>-Of course it was you.
-Henrietta!
</p><timestamp>00:23:36</timestamp>
<p>No. All this "I-don't-know-where-I-am
or-who-my-son-stuff" is,
is officially not cute anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>You ruined the one good thing I had.
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p>The one thing I didn't ruin myself,
but of course I did
because I thought it was a good idea
to give you one more chance.
