<i>If there's one thing I've learned</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:14</timestamp>
<p><i>from this crazy mambo called life,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p><i>it's that anyone can be a birthday father,</i>
<i>but it takes a heart full of birthdays</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p><i>to be a true Birthday Dad.</i>

</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>Oh! Loo-- looks great! Uh, love it!
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>What's wrong with your face?
</p><timestamp>00:00:37</timestamp>
<p>I just don't buy it,
Director Flea Daniels.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>That just doesn't look like the honest,
trustworthy face of a Birthday Dad.
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>This is clearly the face
of a guy who did something terrible,
like, I don't know,
cheat on his girlfriend
with his ex-wife a couple of times,
and instead of confessing
to his girlfriend, asked her to marry him,
so now they're engaged,
and she still has no idea.
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>Can't you see he's racked with guilt?
 It's all over his very handsome face!
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>Did Birthday Dad cheat on his girlfriend?
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>No, I'm just saying he looks like he did.
We have to re-edit the scene.
</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p>No. You've been dragging this out
with your ridiculous tweaks and demands
for what is the stupidest premise
I've ever seen.
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>I gotta go prep my next film,
<i>The Diary of Anne Frankenstein.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>-<i>Birthday Dad</i> is over.
-Huh? No, I'm over!
</p><timestamp>00:01:17</timestamp>
<p>Over the moon about continuing to work
on this project!
</p><timestamp>00:01:20</timestamp>

<p>{\an8}so I'll make this quick.

</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But do you remember the name
of that assistant from, like, 20 years ago
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}who I screamed at for bringing me
a room-temp Capri Sun
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>

<p>{\an8}<i>Derek? I think he quit the business.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So, I gave him good advice, then?
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hey, what do you think of Riley
for a girl's name?
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>No good. I slept with a Riley once.
Didn't end well.
</p><timestamp>00:05:23</timestamp>

about any women's names.

about the <i>Manatee Fair</i> photo shoot

</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah. When is that happening?

<p>Princess Carolyn, why am I not looking

at my photo shoot, so I can decide later
which parts to retouch?
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>-I don't think I can make it, Amanda.
-Too bad. Vanessa Gekko's here.
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>Gekko? Well, that's fine if Vanessa needs
to get the word out
about her struggling business,
but I'm too busy doing it all
to pose for a photo
of "Women Who Do It All."
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>Well, sure, I know that,
and you know that, but does the industry?

<p>Oh, it sounds like you're doing-it-all
for yourself,
but the new doing it all
is doing it all for other women.
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah, well, the twist
about <i>Birthday Dad</i> is the women
have equal screen time to the men
in the movie,
and the same number of birthdays!

<p>-Very subversive.

</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>This is so empowering.
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>

<p>Marian is a vegetarian, Meagan is vegan,

<p>I came up with a bunch more

this boring senator.
</p><timestamp>00:11:36</timestamp>
<p>-Huh?
-Okay, but--
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>Jacinda, like the New Zealand
prime minister
who had a baby while in office.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>Or what about Ravital,
which is Hebrew for an abundance of dew.
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>Is it weird I haven't picked a name yet?
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>Ah! Don't worry about it.

<p>They'd prefer sweeter ones for this event.
But they're okay with Fiji if it's frigid.
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I follow so far.
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>For this gala, Gala apples over Fuji

</p><timestamp>00:12:20</timestamp>
<p>But we have to keep their Fujis frigid.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>

-No, their Fijis frigid.
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>Right. That's what I meant.
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>Also, it turns out Marian is pescatarian,
and Meagan is no longer vegan,
but she is refusing to sit
next to Chrissy Teigen.
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>And now Carrie eats just dairy.

<p>Okay. Marian - pescatarian.
Meagan - not vegan,

</p><timestamp>00:13:24</timestamp>
<p>You mixed all the flashbacks together
with the present-day scenes,
the relationships are incomprehensible,
we don't even know how Birthday Dad dies!

about a young girl in hiding,

<p>So, <i>Birthday Dad</i> needs another pass.

<p>-You can still--
-No. Deuces. I'm outta here.
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>As the Nazi scientists learn
in my new film that I'm just now realizing
is in possibly poor taste,
there are only so many times

<p>-So here I am, digging a hole--

</p><timestamp>00:14:17</timestamp>
<p>I have to pick up my Peanutbutter
at Pastiches

<p>You've been acting different.
</p><timestamp>00:15:52</timestamp>
<p>I first noticed it the night
of the <i>Philbert</i> premiere,
when you came home late
smelling like Diane,
and then after a while,
things went back to normal.
</p><timestamp>00:15:59</timestamp>
<p>But then you got real weird again
right around that time
</p><timestamp>00:16:02</timestamp>
<p>BoJack went to rehab.
</p><timestamp>00:16:03</timestamp>
<p>Right before you proposed that day,
you also smelled like Diane. <subtitle>sniffs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God. I get what's happening.
-Pickles--
</p><timestamp>00:16:09</timestamp>
<p>-You feel guilty.
-You're right.
</p><timestamp>00:16:11</timestamp>
<p>-I feel so guilty because I chea--
-Because your good friend's in rehab.
</p><timestamp>00:16:14</timestamp>
<p>Chiefly feel guilty because
my good friend's in rehab, like you said.
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you go visit him
if this is the thing
that's been weighing on you.

<p>-Hmm...
-<subtitle>indistinct chattering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:05</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, can we go back to the cheating?
Did you tell her about that?
</p><timestamp>00:17:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter, we don't interrupt
when others are sharing.
</p><timestamp>00:17:10</timestamp>
<p>Just looking for a little context.
</p><timestamp>00:17:12</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you go looking in your car?
Maybe you left it there.
</p><timestamp>00:17:14</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, don't interrupt
Mr. Peanutbutter, he's sharing.
</p><timestamp>00:17:16</timestamp>
<p>-No. But he--

</p><timestamp>00:17:19</timestamp>
<p>Thank you, Doctor Champ.
</p><timestamp>00:17:20</timestamp>
<p>As I was saying, I think Doug
needs to be honest with his wife
before they can move forward.
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all</subtitle> Mmm.
-You're right. I need to tell her.
</p><timestamp>00:17:27</timestamp>
<p>But on the other hand,
maybe that's just your guilt talking.
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>Isn't it sometimes better to let
sleeping dogs lie?
</p><timestamp>00:17:32</timestamp>
<p>I-I assume your fiancée is a dog?
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>She's my wife, and she's human.
</p><timestamp>00:17:36</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so your fiancée.
Let's say her name is... Pickles.
</p><timestamp>00:17:40</timestamp>
<p>-Wait, uh...
-She doesn't know,
and she's happy not knowing.
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>Wouldn't telling her now
just cause additional pain?
</p><timestamp>00:17:45</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all</subtitle> Uh-huh.
-So, it's better not to tell her?
</p><timestamp>00:17:48</timestamp>
<p>Oh, well, that's really convenient
for you, Doug!
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>-No, I didn't--
-Hey, everyone, look at "Doug"
deciding that the best option
just happens to be the one
where he doesn't get in trouble!
</p><timestamp>00:17:57</timestamp>
<p>-Mr. Peanutbutter--
-But that's just Doug all over, isn't it?
</p><timestamp>00:18:00</timestamp>
<p>Classic, stupid, selfish,
inconsiderate Doug!
</p><timestamp>00:18:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>indistinct chattering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:06</timestamp>
<p>Wow. Those are harsh words.
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>But I needed to hear them. Thank you.

<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:18:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>Look, I don't know
what's going on with you,
although I'm pretty sure either you
or Doug cheated on Pickles,
but I understand that feeling of needing
to bottle up your guilt,
not burden other people with it.
</p><timestamp>00:18:30</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah?
-You think you're protecting them
from your toxicity, you convince yourself
that you're being selfless, but...
it comes out in other ways
and it infects everything.

</p><timestamp>00:20:22</timestamp>
<p>-You think the project has legs?
-Yeah, she has legs.
</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>
<p>I'm thrilled to meet you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>The whole town is buzzing
about "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project."
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>Weird, but okay.
</p><timestamp>00:20:33</timestamp>
<p>We need something big.
</p><timestamp>00:20:35</timestamp>
<p>Is "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"
the kind of thing
that makes a lot of noise?
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>She sure does!
</p><timestamp>00:20:39</timestamp>
<p>I'm in. Name your price.
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>Um...
</p><timestamp>00:20:42</timestamp>
<p>Jonathan?
</p><timestamp>00:20:44</timestamp>
<p>We took a big swing
with Dick Wolf's Milwaukee shows.
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>Turns out audiences are not interested
in a whole night of Milwaukee,
so now we've got some slots to fill.
</p><timestamp>00:20:51</timestamp>
<p>Do you think
"Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"
could live for several seasons?
</p><timestamp>00:20:56</timestamp>
<p>I don't see how those things are related,
but I certainly hope so!
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>-Well, how can I help?
-You wanna help?
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>Let's start with a two-season pick up.
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, sure, pick-up, drop-off,
whatever works best for you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:08</timestamp>
<p>-That would be great.
-Great!
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>baby giggles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>Well, here she is.
What time do you want me to pick her up?
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>Wait, it's a baby?
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>-And she has legs!
-<subtitle>coos</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>I already canceled
<i>Milwaukee Waste Management.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:21</timestamp>
<p>I told the shareholders
this was gonna save the network!
</p><timestamp>00:21:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-We designed the poster!
-<subtitle>coos</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p>Todd, we need a show. We can't air a baby!
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>blows raspberry</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:31</timestamp>
<p>So, long story short,
Pinky canceled the baby,
but now we owe him a TV show.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>So, the show is called <i>Birthday Dad.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>The pilot was directed by Flea Daniels,
and the show will be run by Karen Kitada.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>The creator of <i>Med School Nights?</i>
And <i>Med School Nights: The New Class,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p><i>Med School Nights Goes to Law School?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-This show's about a dad
who died on his birthday,
and every episode,
his spirit visits a different
intersectionally representative person
on their birthday
to help them work
through their own issues.
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>But how are all these characters related?
When does the show take place?
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>How does Birthday Dad die?
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>Those are mysteries we'll tease
all season!
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>-Uh-huh.
<i>-Birthday Dad,</i> you'll laugh, you'll cry,
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>-you'll Birthday Dad!
-What do you think?
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, like I said, we'll take anything.
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>phone ringing, beeps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah?
<i>-</i><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> <i>Hey.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>Um, so, I don't wanna waste any more
of your time.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>I just wanted to say that I know
you're really busy
and I'm sorry for making your life
more difficult this week and also always.
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>Also, I know that my apologies
are pretty much meaningless at this point,
and I'm sorry for that, too.
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p>Why didn't you tell me
about the <i>Friends and Family Meetings?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. You got so much goin' on,
I didn't wanna bother you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>
<p>I would have come.
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>elevator dings</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>pants</subtitle> Did I miss it?
Is the Do-It-All-Ball all done?
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>Yes. We did it all.
Good of you to show up, by the way.
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah? Well, it's good of you to, uh...
</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p>Shut up!
</p><timestamp>00:23:07</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>Are you okay?
You're not your usual medium-clever self.
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>Can I ask you something?
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>So, there's work, right?
I mean, work makes sense to me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>And I'm good at it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>I don't feel that way about my baby.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>I don't think
I'm feeling what I'm supposed to feel.
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p>What I thought I would feel.
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I love her, of course I do.
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>Of course I love my daughter.
But... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>But I don't know if I <i>love </i>her.
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>I know I'm a terrible person
for even thinking it,
but... what if it never happens?
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>Do you love all your clients' projects?
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p>-Of course.
-No, you don't.
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>But you take care of them
and you keep them alive
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>-because that's your job, right?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>So, now you've got a new job.
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>And it is a ruthless one,
and I mean ruthless.
</p><timestamp>00:24:06</timestamp>
<p>You don't have time to waste
second-guessing how you feel about it.
</p><timestamp>00:24:08</timestamp>
<p>You just have to do it
the best that you can,
and know that that's the best you can do.
</p><timestamp>00:24:14</timestamp>
<p>You know,
<subtitle>scoffs</subtitle> we have so much in common.
</p><timestamp>00:24:17</timestamp>
<p>I don't know why we've spent
so many years hating each other.
</p><timestamp>00:24:20</timestamp>
<p>I never hated you. Did you hate me?
</p><timestamp>00:24:23</timestamp>
<p>Uh... no.
</p><timestamp>00:24:26</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>cries</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p>Hey. <subtitle>shushes</subtitle> Hey. Please. Listen.
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>-Did you get the Fijis for the Fugees?
-<subtitle>giggling</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:34</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Is that silly?
</p><timestamp>00:24:37</timestamp>
<p>The Fugees were egregious
when they got interviewed by Regis.
</p><timestamp>00:24:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>both giggling</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:44</timestamp>
<p>Isn't that right...
