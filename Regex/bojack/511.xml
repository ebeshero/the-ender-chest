why they call you "Sassy."
</p><timestamp>00:00:14</timestamp>
<p>-Hello, old friend.
-Fritz! But you're dead!
</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p>Dead serious... about haunting you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:20</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> I haven't had sex that good
since my wife died.
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>To be clear, the sex was pre-death.
</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>Philbert, I don't want to be
one of those girls,
but did you murder your wife?
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>How many people are dead because of you?
</p><timestamp>00:00:31</timestamp>
<p>Those were bad guys!
They stole the mayor's submarine.
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>Tell me what happened.
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm going to the chief!
The whole world's gonna know what you did.
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>-You can't do that, Marjorie.

<p>Fritz, you maniac! What are you doing?

<p>{\an8}Oh, Philbert, that's awful.

<p>No, that's a cliché.

</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Gina, you noticed anything funky
about these new scripts?
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yeah. Without Diane around to police
Flip's use of the word "literally,"
</p><timestamp>00:04:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}you'd think "the literally store"
was going out of business. Figuratively.
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What? No. I mean the story with the chief.
I think it's stolen from my life.
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I also had a male boss who died.
Herb Kazazz.
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>Seems like a coincidence.
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>The chief is named Basil.
Like basil, which is an herb! Like Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>I don't think anyone would use a story
from your life without telling you.
</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>-Diane would.
-She's not writing on the show anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>You think Flip read her book?
Wait a minute. "Her book." "Herb... <i>ook."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>-What's going on with you?
-I'm gonna get to the bottom of this

<p>-What?
-BoJack, I care about you,

who will be out of a job
if you spin out like you usually do.
Now are you keeping things together?

<p>I'm not gonna screw up
this professional opportunity for you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>Your concern is very touching.
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>-What's in those pills you keep taking?
-If you really cared,
you should've been there
the day I fell off a building?
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>But no. You had other important business
to attend to.

making me feel like you give a shit.
You're gonna be an awesome mom.

<p>"Ya think?"
And sundry retorts of that fashion.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>Here's what's gonna happen.

<p>You're gonna take
the rest of the night off.

<p>You're gonna get some sleep.

you're gonna be professional,
you're gonna be courteous,
and you're gonna have your shit together.

<p>Fine! And... I'm sorry,

Kinda fun to think

</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>speaking with mock Scottish accent</subtitle>
On a scale of one to ten,
how would you rate your cable service?
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's a tough one, right off the bat.
Let's see.
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>Don't take this personally,
but I'm gonna say eight.
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>And on a scale of one to ten,
how is your marriage?

my wife and I had some rough patches,
but we're stronger
now we've got through them.
</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>-I'm gonna give us an eight.
-Okay, so it sounds like your wife
isn't obsessed with a desire
to exact revenge on a former friend?

<p>-What?
-For cable-related reasons or otherwise?

<p>Pfft. I don't even know how to judge that.
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>Uh, let's say
that one is, "Horribly scarred
by an older man she trusted
and is now dedicated to getting
the word out about the bad thing he did,"
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>

and ten is, "Slowly explored her body

</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>I don't know, maybe eight?

</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>-I noticed.
-I've noticed you noticing.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>I've made some progress in our case,
but, uh... you're not gonna like it.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>-Try me.
-It's about Fritz.

</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>So, I guess some of this detective stuff
is starting to rub off on me,
because I figured out
what's been going on with you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:08</timestamp>
<p>-Gina?
-I found your stashes
in the toilet paper rolls.
Then I looked around the house
and found all your other
clever little hiding places.
</p><timestamp>00:21:15</timestamp>
<p>-How many of these do you take a day?
-Hey. Those are mine. Okay? I need those.
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Gina gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>I swear to God,
you try that again and you're dead.
</p><timestamp>00:21:23</timestamp>
<p>Sassy, I'm not the bad guy here.
It's Fritz.
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p>I didn't want to tell you this,
but he's back.
</p><timestamp>00:21:27</timestamp>
<p>I don't know how. Maybe the nuclear blast
resurrected him somehow.
</p><timestamp>00:21:31</timestamp>
<p>You're my partner. We need to find him.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm with Internal Affairs, you moron.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>When you told me Fritz killed your wife,
something didn't add up.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>I tried to find Fritz in the system, but
there's no record of him ever existing.
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-In fact,
there's no record of you
ever having a partner at all.
</p><timestamp>00:21:44</timestamp>
<p>What are you saying?
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>You killed your wife. And the chief.
And the coroner. And the others.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>Why would I do that?
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>Because they knew you,
and they knew your secrets.
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>But I know your secrets now.
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>-But did you know that I love bocce ball?

</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>You have no idea what I'm going through.
I'm trying to protect you, Gina!
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>Protect me from what?
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>-Are you serious?
-Someone is trying to blackmail me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack, this is from the show.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>It's marketing.
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-<subtitle>Gina</subtitle> Everyone in L.A. got one.
-Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>It's a copy of the note
that Philbert gets.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>-You sent this note. It was <i>you.</i>
-No, Philbert.

<p><subtitle>Sassy</subtitle> <i>It was you.</i>

<p>You don't remember shooting that scene?
</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>
<p>Well, I-- I guess
I've been a little distracted.
</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p>"Distracted"? You've been high.
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>No. It's not high, Gina, that's not--
It makes things normal.
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>Normal? You're a goddamn mess,
and you're gonna ruin my show.
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, <i>your </i>show?
-That's not what I meant.
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>No, that's very helpful.
I understand what you're worried about.
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>-I thought it was me, but it's your show.
-BoJack, listen.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>It would really be a shame
if your show was ruined
by your boyfriend's
debilitating drug problem.
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>-Stop it.
-Where would you go to sing
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>-with your popsicle dancers?
-Popsicle dancers?
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>-Give me my pills back!
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p>So, what happens now?
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>-Turn yourself in.
-Are you kidding?
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>I know there's a good man
buried somewhere in there, Philbert.
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>He's the man I fell in love with.
