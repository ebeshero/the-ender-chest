<p><subtitle>man</subtitle> So you said let's do the show
about the horse,
</p><timestamp>00:00:08</timestamp>
<p>-but this time without the horse.
-<subtitle>woman</subtitle> I know, I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:00:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man</subtitle> And I said,
"That's a terrible idea."
</p><timestamp>00:00:13</timestamp>
<p>And you said, "I got someone
even better." I got...
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>-What's this asshole's name again?
-Vincent D'Onofrio.
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>-And here we are.

</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Zoe. Hey, Zelda.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>-I forgot my boombox.
-And your deodorant.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>-Pee-yew, mister.
-<subtitle>audience laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:31</timestamp>
<p>-Zoe, that's no way to get adopted.
-Adopted, by me?
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>Children, I'm a single
breakdancing instructor
who can barely take care of himself.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>Plus, I'm too rad to be a dad.
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>rhythmic grunting</subtitle> Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>And shake it up. Hah!
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>klaxon blares</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>It's fine, Katrina. If I didn't randomly
wander into doors all the time,
</p><timestamp>00:00:54</timestamp>
<p>I never would have ended up
co-piloting the very plane
that brought me to Los Angeles.
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me, didn't you see
the flashing red light outside the door?
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>Of course. That's why I stopped...
what I was doing to come inside.
</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, are you filming a sitcom?
I love sitcoms!
</p><timestamp>00:01:10</timestamp>
<p>You should have a character say,
"Talk to the hand."
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p>The hand! Not the face,
where the ears are.
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>-Newsflash: hands can't hear.
-<subtitle>laughter and applause</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>What do you mean the character
needs to be more likable?
</p><timestamp>00:01:21</timestamp>
<p>They don't teach likability
at the American Stanislavski Theatre.
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>Look, this is not about your acting.
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p>You don't want an actor,
you want a blank canvas
upon which to project your own
mawkish notions of goodness.
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>Some man for all seasons
up for a bit of anything--
cheerful, optimistic, indomitable.
</p><timestamp>00:01:37</timestamp>
<p>I assure you no such man exists.
</p><timestamp>00:01:40</timestamp>
<p>But you're welcome to keep looking.
</p><timestamp>00:01:43</timestamp>
<p>This D'Onofrio has had enoughfrio.
</p><timestamp>00:01:45</timestamp>
<p>-Hah hah!
-Hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:01:46</timestamp>
<p>But my favorite scenes
are when a character
is completely oblivious to something
really important going on behind him.
</p><timestamp>00:01:53</timestamp>
<p>That, dear friends, is where the sit
truly hits the com.
</p><timestamp>00:01:56</timestamp>
<p>-Excuse me.
-Kind of in the middle of something.
</p><timestamp>00:01:58</timestamp>
<p>-He's yakking away, tension's building...
-Hey, you, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:02:00</timestamp>
<p>...the audience is like,
"Hey, turn around."
</p><timestamp>00:02:02</timestamp>
<p>Maybe the person behind him
even interrupts him--
</p><timestamp>00:02:04</timestamp>
<p>-Can we talk to you for a second?
-Just like that.
</p><timestamp>00:02:06</timestamp>
<p>And then, when it would be ridiculous
to go on even one second longer...
</p><timestamp>00:02:10</timestamp>
<p>-My name is David Chase.
-Do you mind?
</p><timestamp>00:02:12</timestamp>
<p>Only then does he say,
exasperated,
</p><timestamp>00:02:15</timestamp>
<p>"What? What do you want?"
</p><timestamp>00:02:17</timestamp>
<p>I want your face on billboards,
you beautiful nonsensical clown prince.
</p><timestamp>00:02:20</timestamp>
<p>-Doggie-doggie what now?
-<subtitle>laughter and applause</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:24</timestamp>
<p>Kid, how'd you like to be the star of
"Untitled <i>Horsin' Around</i> Knockoff"?
</p><timestamp>00:02:29</timestamp>
<p>Me, a star? But I have
no experience, no formal training.
</p><timestamp>00:02:33</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you, you don't need
any of those things.
</p><timestamp>00:02:36</timestamp>
<p>You got "it."

<p>Uh, no. We're about 4,000 signatures shy

and the deadline's in a week.

<p>{\an8}Oh, I never developed a signature.
I find them unnecessarily ostentatious.

<p>Oh, that's right! What train wreck
are we rubbernecking at this year?

-So, as we discussed earlier,
is this one of the moments
where you would want privacy?
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>You know what I'd do
if I had eight million dollars?
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, you'd give it to the waitress.
-Oh, no, no, no.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>I mean, if I had
eight million dollars now,
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>I'd start a company that makes
remote-controlled drones.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>But these drones have a seat
hanging from the bottom
so you can fly around in it.
</p><timestamp>00:06:43</timestamp>
<p>A drone with a throne.
A drone throne.
</p><timestamp>00:06:47</timestamp>
<p>But if you're in it, isn't it not a drone?
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>I feel like you're getting
really hung up on labels.
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>Well, anyways,
with my eight million dollars
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>I'm starting a new dating app
just for firemen
and redheaded women named Emily.
</p><timestamp>00:07:00</timestamp>
<p>Aww, you don't need an app,
just hang out with me.
</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p>Todd, you're great.
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>What a way to end a sentence.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>But I want a boyfriend who isn't asexual.
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>Whoa. Why did you call me that?
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>No, no, it's not bad.
I didn't mean it negatively.
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>-I was just, like, stating it.
-I'm not-- that word doesn't describe--
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>Okay, okay, I'm sorry,
whatever you call yourself,
you're my friend and I support you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>But sometimes labels can be helpful.
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>Wow. Well, I would label
this conversation "rough".
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>Here's the check.

</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>-I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.
-You know, it's funny.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>Personally I like Woodchuck
and he's a fine governor,
but for some reason, even though
I have zero qualifications,
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>I honestly thought I would have made
an even better governor.
</p><timestamp>00:10:15</timestamp>
<p>-Well, what matters is you tried.
-But I would have been good, right?
</p><timestamp>00:10:18</timestamp>
<p>Now that there's no chance
you will ever be governor,
</p><timestamp>00:10:21</timestamp>
<p>I can tell you honestly...
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>-Yes. You would have been great.

</p><timestamp>00:10:26</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>

you follow your heart.

<p>Those are important qualities

-Race. That's it, Diane!
</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>
<p>You diabolical Thin Mint.
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>You, and only you, are responsible
for the great thing I am about to do.

<p>Thank you, thank you.

<p>Moments ago I found myself
in what seemed to be a no-win situation.
</p><timestamp>00:11:02</timestamp>
<p>But it turns out
it was a "Nguyen situation."
</p><timestamp>00:11:05</timestamp>
<p>I'm referring of course
to my supportive wife Diane Nguyen,
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>-who told me to never give up!
-<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:12</timestamp>
<p>And that's why I am challenging
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p>-to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>No more petitions
or fancy ballot initiatives,
just a mano a mano,
no-holds-barred slippery slalom
down an ice-covered peak.
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p>Winner gets to be governor,
loser goes home.
</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p>Your move, Governor.

<p>-Aaah!
-<subtitle>cheering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Woodchuck</subtitle>
What the hell is he talking about?
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>It sounds like he's challenging you
to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>What an absurd conceit.
Do I even need to respond to this?
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>No, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>Because I'd rather focus
on my drought relief optimization
using geohydration technology,
or DROUGHT plan.
</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p>If I know anything, this story
will go away in a couple of days.
</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p>Now Mr. Peanutbutter, you challenged
Woodchuck to a ski race a month ago.
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Not just any ski race, a high-stakes dash
down Devil's Mountain
</p><timestamp>00:12:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-for the governorship itself.
-But still no comment from the governor.
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>Why won't he race you?
That's what I want to know.
</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>You and me both, friendo.
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>But this isn't an us-ocracy,
it's a dem-ocracy.
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>audience</subtitle> Ooh!
-So let's ask "dem" what "dey" think.
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>cheers and applause</subtitle>
-Any questions for the governor, folks?
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>audience chants</subtitle>
Why won't Woodchuck race?
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>So, to be clear, my DROUGHT plan
is actually a drought relief plan.
</p><timestamp>00:12:30</timestamp>
<p>I see now how that's confusing.
Any other questions?
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>Are you going to race Mr. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:12:34</timestamp>
<p>Any questions about the DROUGHT plan?
</p><timestamp>00:12:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}To ski or not to ski?
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That was the question
posed by William Shakespeare
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and it's perhaps even more relevant today.
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Of course, there <i>are </i>reasons
why a gubernatorial election
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}should not be decided by a ski race,
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}but are there also reasons
why it should?
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}For the sake of "fairness"
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}we've brought in two experts
with opposite opinions
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}who will now have equal time
to just say those opinions
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}because that's what news is.
</p><timestamp>00:13:02</timestamp>
<p>You think they'll really race
down Devil's Mountain?
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p>What do I care? As long as I've got
my giant bag of kettle corn,
that's the only thing that concerns me.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Todd grunts</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:13:14</timestamp>
<p>Get back here with my kettle corn!
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>You can't call it a drone
if you're riding on it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>Suckers! Hooray!
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>Ha ha! Oh-- oh, no!
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>Aw, man.
</p><timestamp>00:13:24</timestamp>
<p>I was hoisted by my own petard,
the one petard I thought
would never hoist me.
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Woodchuck</subtitle> Unprecedented poppycock.
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>This poppycock has no precedent.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>Maybe it's time to make a statement.
</p><timestamp>00:13:38</timestamp>
<p>Madeline, no.
</p><timestamp>00:13:40</timestamp>
<p>This outlandish buffoonery
is beneath the office of the governor.
</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>I can't defile the legacy
of my predecessors
who built the Golden Gate Bridge,
irrigated the Central Valley,
and played Mr. Freeze in a Batman movie.
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>Can't you see this thing
is eating you alive?
</p><timestamp>00:13:54</timestamp>
<p>Do it for us, Woodcharles.
Do it for us.
</p><timestamp>00:13:58</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>And so this ski race would be both
undemocratic and unconstitutional,
which is why I will not be racing
Mr. Peanutbutter down Devil's Mountain.
</p><timestamp>00:14:10</timestamp>
<p>What if the state constitution
were changed to allow it?
</p><timestamp>00:14:13</timestamp>
<p>-Then would you race Mr. Peanutbutter?
-I... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:17</timestamp>
<p>Fine. If a state senator
wanted to waste everybody's time
by sponsoring an amendment
to the constitution,
and the motion got two-thirds majority
in both houses
so as to allow
a democratically-elected governor
to accept a ski race challenge
for his office,
then yes, I would race Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>Well, I guess that puts
that idea to bed, right?
</p><timestamp>00:14:38</timestamp>
<p>-Hmm.
-Right?
</p><timestamp>00:14:40</timestamp>
<p>-Hmm... <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
-Right?!
</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>You want me to sponsor a ski race
amendment to the constitution?
</p><timestamp>00:14:51</timestamp>
<p>Or you could sponsor the amendment
that has a hidden rider
doubling farm subsidies in your district.
</p><timestamp>00:14:56</timestamp>
<p>-Inglewood could use some farms.
-That's right.
</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>I do have these campaign donors--
uh, I mean, constituents
who really care about babies' access
to vaping devices.
</p><timestamp>00:15:05</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>coughing</subtitle>
-Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:15:07</timestamp>
<p>I've always wanted to drive across
a bridge to Hawaii.
</p><timestamp>00:15:11</timestamp>
<p>-Can we do that?
-You got it.
</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>
<p>Aloha! <subtitle>giggles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:14</timestamp>
<p>Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Whoo!
</p><timestamp>00:15:17</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> It tickles.
</p><timestamp>00:15:21</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:23</timestamp>
<p>I'm astounded that it has come to this.
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>But since the exorbitantly expensive
and astonishingly titled I Love California
amendment is now law,
</p><timestamp>00:15:34</timestamp>
<p>I formally accept Mr. Peanutbutter's
challenge to a ski race.
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>
<p>It happens that I'm an excellent skier
who won numerous medals in the sport
when I raced for Dartmouth
but, again, I am shocked
that fact is relevant
in the matter of selecting
our state's governor.
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter, I will see you
on Devil's Mountain.
</p><timestamp>00:15:54</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa!
-This is insane.
</p><timestamp>00:15:56</timestamp>
<p>You could actually become governor
by winning a race.
</p><timestamp>00:15:58</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Wow.
</p><timestamp>00:16:00</timestamp>
<p>You know, it's days like this
I wish I knew how to ski.
</p><timestamp>00:16:04</timestamp>
<p>-You don't ski?
-Never really got into it, no.
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>Then why did you challenge the governor
to a ski race?
</p><timestamp>00:16:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> I didn't think
it would get this far.
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>
<p>You gotta admit, this is pretty out there.
</p><timestamp>00:16:15</timestamp>
<p>Well, I guess that's it. Oh, well.
Tough break. Bye forever, Katrina.
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>No, this is not over.
This is just beginning.
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter,
you're going to ski school.
</p><timestamp>00:16:25</timestamp>

<p><i>Don't know if you've seen the news,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:16:39</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm off to ski school
so I can learn how to ski,
so I can become the governor.
</p><timestamp>00:16:44</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:16:47</timestamp>
<p>Sounds great, sweetheart.
</p><timestamp>00:16:49</timestamp>
<p>But as the old saying goes,
that's politics.
</p><timestamp>00:16:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> <i>Then you'd probably say,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>Peanutbutter, is it?
Everything about you disgusts me.
</p><timestamp>00:18:13</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>And yet, there might be
something in you after all.
</p><timestamp>00:18:18</timestamp>
<p>You really mean it?
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>This shall be my greatest challenge.
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p>Meet me on the summit
tomorrow at daybreak.
</p><timestamp>00:18:25</timestamp>
<p>Well, it is daybreak
and here we are at the summit.
</p><timestamp>00:18:28</timestamp>

<p>Oh, I don't have skis.

<p>-You didn't say that.
-No bother. They shan't be required.
</p><timestamp>00:18:36</timestamp>
<p>Instead, read this book of poetry.

<p>I'll see you in the classroom.

Are you sure, though,
because last time you seemed
a little hesitant.
</p><timestamp>00:20:39</timestamp>
<p>-No, I was just a little pregnant.
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:20:42</timestamp>
<p>I was gonna tell you, really,
but then before I could tell you
there was nothing to tell you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:20:48</timestamp>
<p>I'm so sorry. I still wish
you would've told me.
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>
<p>I have a card for that. On the front
it says, "Life isn't fairage."
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. I just felt dumb
because all my life I've wanted a family.
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>But I didn't want it to happen
just because I got pregnant by accident
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>-and then you got stuck with me.
-Okay, first of all,
if I get stuck to something,
you're the prettiest glue trap I ever saw.
</p><timestamp>00:21:07</timestamp>
<p>-You know what I mean.
-Second, if that's how you feel,
maybe you shouldn't get pregnant
by accident.
</p><timestamp>00:21:13</timestamp>
<p>-Well, I didn't try to!
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>I'm saying maybe we should
get you pregnant on purpose.

<p>-Really?

<p>We love each other,

</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>Woodchuck in the lead,
still in the lead.
</p><timestamp>00:21:44</timestamp>
<p>Woodchuck remains
very much in the lead.
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>Goodbye, dear friend.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>You served me well.

<p>Go, Woodcharles!

</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>-Did I win?
-Come on, honey.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>Let's go home.
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>applause</subtitle>
-Well, I hope that settles it.
</p><timestamp>00:22:41</timestamp>
<p>We can finally put an end
to this nonsense.
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>
<p>Sir, the rules are clear: the first person
to cross the finish line becomes governor,
and, well, a strange boy
fell out of the sky
and crossed the line first.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>They're swearing him in now.
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p>-So help me Todd.
-Congratulations, Governor Chavez.
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>cheers and applause</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>You know, ever since
I first became governor
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>I've thought,
"I don't want to be governor"
and that's where I am now.
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>So, can I not be governor?
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groaning and gasping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>You'd like to resign?
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I'm just really not
into labels right now.
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p>Maybe after some soul searching
I'll be ready to really know what I am.
</p><timestamp>00:23:17</timestamp>
<p>But for right now,
I think I speak for all Californians
when I say, "I ate too much kettle corn
while drifting through the sky
on an out of control drone throne."
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p>Okay, is this charade over?
Can I be governor again?
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>Sir, we live in a society of laws.
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>When a governor resigns,
that triggers a special election.
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>Until which, the governor's seat
shall remain vacant.
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all gasping</subtitle>
-Election, you say?
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter, will you run?
</p><timestamp>00:23:46</timestamp>
<p>-You bet I will, and you know why?
-No, tell me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>Because this whole ski race was a joke.
</p><timestamp>00:23:52</timestamp>
<p>Of course Woodchuck was gonna beat me.
He went to Dartmouth.
</p><timestamp>00:23:55</timestamp>
<p>So where's the candidate
for regular schmoes like me,
</p><timestamp>00:23:57</timestamp>
<p>-who went to Northwestern?
-Is he serious right now?
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>You know, Governor Woodchuck
Coodchuck-Berkowitz
thinks he's better than us,
but is he better than us?
</p><timestamp>00:24:05</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>crowd</subtitle> No!
-Uh, if I could say a few words--
</p><timestamp>00:24:08</timestamp>
<p>He thinks the race is over.
</p><timestamp>00:24:09</timestamp>
<p>Well, I say it's just starting.
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>And he wants me to sit and stay
and roll over?
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>-No!
-I say California's tired of rolling over.
</p><timestamp>00:24:19</timestamp>
<p>What do you say?
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>crowd</subtitle> Yeah!
-<subtitle>woman</subtitle> I'm tired.
</p><timestamp>00:24:23</timestamp>
<p>I say it's time for me
to stand up and speak.
</p><timestamp>00:24:26</timestamp>
