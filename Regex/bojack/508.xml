<p>Halloween. Fright Night.
Spook-tober 30-cursed!
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>Oh, there's the light switch.
I'm still getting used to this new house.
</p><timestamp>00:00:18</timestamp>
<p>I just bought it and it's the '60s!
No, I'm just kidding!
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>It's 1993, and I'm wearing a costume!
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>Groovy threads!
But you just got drafted, hippie!
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>-Hmm?
-Into the cutest husband army!
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>laughs, moans</subtitle>
-Aw!
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>Where's your costume?
</p><timestamp>00:00:33</timestamp>
<p>Can't I just wear a dumb hat
and say I'm Blossom?
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>In my opinionation... Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:00:37</timestamp>
<p>I am so excited to go
to a real Hollywood party
with my husband the TV star.
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p>Just do me a favor
and don't leave me alone, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:00:45</timestamp>
<p>-Okay!
-Now hurry up and finish getting ready.
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p>I'm kidding.
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>Can you imagine
if I spoke to you like that?
</p><timestamp>00:00:51</timestamp>
<p>I really can't!
</p><timestamp>00:00:52</timestamp>
<p>Next time, we're doing
a couples costume, though!
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>It's the perfect way to tell the world
that you are completely on the same...
</p><timestamp>00:00:59</timestamp>
<p>-<i>paaaaage?</i>
-What are you wearing?
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>I thought we were going
as Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling
in the this-year 2004 hit film
<i>The Notebook.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p><i>Ooοοοh!</i> You just said, <i>"The Notebook."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:09</timestamp>
<p>I thought you were gonna be, like,
a pen or something.
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>The important thing is
we both look super-cute,
and everyone is gonna be, like,
</p><timestamp>00:01:15</timestamp>
<p>"Hey, is that Jessica Biel
from the upcoming<i> Blade: Trinity?''</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>And I'll say my famous<i> Blade: Trinity</i>
catchphrase, "Stop goofin' around, Blade!"
</p><timestamp>00:01:22</timestamp>
<p>Are you sure you're gonna be okay
at this party?
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p>Whenever I went with Katrina,
we'd always end up in a big fight.
</p><timestamp>00:01:27</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm not Katrina.
This is gonna be fun.
</p><timestamp>00:01:29</timestamp>
<p>Okay. I just know you're afraid
of mummies.
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>And since it's Halloween,
we might see some mummies.
</p><timestamp>00:01:34</timestamp>
<p>I'm not afraid of mummies.
</p><timestamp>00:01:36</timestamp>
<p>I just don't like them
because of an incident...
from my past.
</p><timestamp>00:01:41</timestamp>
<p>Will you stay on the lookout
and keep those creepy corpses away?
</p><timestamp>00:01:44</timestamp>
<p>I'll be sure to make
a mental<i> note</i> of it!
</p><timestamp>00:01:47</timestamp>
<p>I'm a notebook.
</p><timestamp>00:01:49</timestamp>
<p>I'm not sure I get our costumes.
</p><timestamp>00:01:50</timestamp>
<p>You're the guy from<i> The Hangover.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:52</timestamp>
<p>The first one, which just came out
this year. Why did I say "first one?"
</p><timestamp>00:01:55</timestamp>
<p>There's only one<i> Hangover</i> movie,
and it's 2009.
</p><timestamp>00:01:58</timestamp>
<p>-And you are...?
-Your Baby Bjorn Borg.
</p><timestamp>00:02:03</timestamp>
<p>Famous '70s tennis player!
</p><timestamp>00:02:04</timestamp>
<p>-And what's with the robot stuff?
-Borg. From<i> Star Trek?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:07</timestamp>
<p>And you're also a baby?
</p><timestamp>00:02:08</timestamp>
<p>In<i> The Hangover,</i> the guy had a Baby Bjorn.
Baby Bjorn Borg.
</p><timestamp>00:02:12</timestamp>
<p>-Seems like a lot of explaining.
-People will get it.
</p><timestamp>00:02:15</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, we are going to have fun
at this party!
</p><timestamp>00:02:18</timestamp>
<p>You said BoJack Horseman
is gonna be there?
</p><timestamp>00:02:20</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God. I'm so nervous.
</p><timestamp>00:02:22</timestamp>
<p>I'm not! Every Halloween party I went to
with one of my ex-wives,
we'd get in a huge blow out.
</p><timestamp>00:02:27</timestamp>
<p>I am so relieved that you are fun
and easygoing,
</p><timestamp>00:02:30</timestamp>
<p>-so there's no danger of that happening!
-Mm-hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:02:33</timestamp>
<p>I love that we both love parties.
But more than that...
</p><timestamp>00:02:36</timestamp>
<p>-I love you.
-Aw, I love you, too.
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>And I love these costumes!
</p><timestamp>00:02:40</timestamp>
<p>But tell me one more time,
what are these costumes?
</p><timestamp>00:02:42</timestamp>
<p>We're new social media app
sensation Tweed Feed!
</p><timestamp>00:02:46</timestamp>
<p>It's Insta plus Snapchat...
if they both boinked Friendster,
which I guess was a thing in the '70s?
</p><timestamp>00:02:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Believe you me.
This party is going to be dope. Booyah!
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>It'll be off the heezy fo' sheezy.
</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>OMG, it's gonna be cray-cray!
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>Turnt! This is going to be
the best Halloween ever!
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>theme music playing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Wow. My first fancy Hollywoo party.
"I'm ready for my close up!"
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Nice!
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>-Sunset Boulevard?</i>
-I usually take <i>Fountain.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>BoJack must really love Halloween
if he has this big bash every year, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:04:16</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah, he's a real fiend for the 'ween.

<p>{\an8}-Who are you and what are you doing here?
-<subtitle>chuckling</subtitle> Good one!
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Pretending not to know your old friend
Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:04:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Why are you at my house?
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Remember when I invited you
to my Halloween party, and you said,
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}you'd love to come, but couldn't
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}because you were having
your own Halloween party?
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, right.
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, I'm sure my guests will show up
any minute, so, you should probably go.
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, I figured,
"Hey, why not have a crossover party?"
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So, I brought my party, wait for it,
to you!
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That was the first ever <i>"Wait for it!"</i>
It's 1993!
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Uh...
-Come on in, guys!

</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}God damn it, why are you here?
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}At the end of last year's Halloween party,
you said, "Let's do this again next year,"
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}like you've said at every Halloween party
for the last 11 years!
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>cheering, whooping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>That does not sound like me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no. Mr. Peanutbutter?
Partygoers? No. Is it--
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>Sure is!
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>Happy "Your 25-Years-Running"
Halloween Party!
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>cheering</subtitle>
-Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween!
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>-Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween!
-No. Don't. Please. Don't. No. You see--
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>So, we're having a party?
Why didn't you say this was happening?
</p><timestamp>00:05:23</timestamp>
<p>Because I hate that it happens.
I take no action to make it happen.
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Every year, I pray that it won't happen,
and it keeps happening anyway!
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I feel like an idiot being
at a Halloween party without a costume.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Who cares? I don't have a costume.
-Uh, you're wearing a costume.
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>Do you mean, in the sense
that we all wear costumes,
such as we reveal facets of ourselves
to those closest to us,
but our truest selves remain hidden?
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p>No, in the sense
that you are literally wearing a costume
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>-from the TV show we both work on.
-Oh, yeah!
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>I'll go to Rite Aid to see
what I can arrange.
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>Don't let the party end
before I get back.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>I definitely will let it die down!
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>Oh, shit, the Halloween party.

</p><timestamp>00:06:03</timestamp>
<p>-You! Marv's intern!

<p>-<subtitle>glass shatters</subtitle>
-I'm very good at opening doors.
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>Do you have any candy
for trick-or-treaters?
</p><timestamp>00:06:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No. I don't know.
Just hand out these Emmy screeners.
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>I'm on it.
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>Those kids'll be holding out their hands
for Franz.
</p><timestamp>00:06:16</timestamp>
<p>Why grip a Twix when you can Sip-o-wicz?
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What? I don't-- Just keep answering
the door until I tell you to stop.
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>-You got it, chief!
-<subtitle>doorbell rings, horse neighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>-Diane! What are you supposed to be?
-An annoyed writer who hates Halloween.
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>Well, you are nailing it.
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>I'm just here to drop off pages
for BoJack. How's the party?
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>I wouldn't know.
I'm stuck on door duty, like always.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>doorbell rings, horse neighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Trick or treat!
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>No. You are way too old
to be trick-or-treating,
and way too young to be a guest
at this party.
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no! Why did I give you the option
of trick or treat? I just wanted treat!
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>Come back when you're five years older,
or three years younger.
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>doorbell rings, horse neighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>How 'bout now?
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Come on in.
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa! Cool house.
-Oh, thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>-It's not mine. It's my boyfriend's.
-Really?
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>-Why does he make you answer the door?
-No, he doesn't make me, he's--
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God. You're right! What am I doing?
What am I doing with my life?
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>Uh, well, judging by your outfit,
I'd say you're a pilot of some sort?
</p><timestamp>00:07:13</timestamp>
<p>I moved to L.A. when I was 18
and now I'm 35!
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>-Everything's happening so fast!
-Oh, no! I'm 18!
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>Am I going to be 35 soon?
That's when they make you president!
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>I don't want that!
That's too much responsibility!
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>I can't do this anymore.
You! Take my shift!
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no!
The responsibilities are already starting!
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>I gotta live my life!
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>I deserve to be adored by a man,
yet here my dreams lie dormant!
</p><timestamp>00:07:36</timestamp>
<p>I don't mean to get mordantly morbid,
but did I get all adorably adorned
to get bored manning doors? No more!
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>Okay, this cider has not been
sufficiently alcoholed.
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>If I'm trapped here with all you losers,
I'm at least getting drunk.
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sips</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:51</timestamp>
<p>Whoa! God! I think
somebody spiked the cider!
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Well, I guess
one drink won't hurt.
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>No, I get that it's the<i> X-Files.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:57</timestamp>
<p>I'm just saying, what happened to the "A"
through "W" Files?
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p>I wanna see that show. More files!
</p><timestamp>00:08:03</timestamp>
<p>-Hey.
-Oh, hey, there you are!
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>Sweetheart, you disappeared
while I was in the bathroom.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just
got distracted by the fun party.
</p><timestamp>00:08:11</timestamp>
<p>But I will not leave your side agai--
Oh, my God, is that Erica?
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>No, no, please don't go talk to Erica.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>Katrina. Erica doesn't know anybody else
at this party.
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>It would be rude to leave her
all by herself.
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>Well, can I at least come with you?
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>You know Erica can't talk
to two people at once
on account of her split-brain procedure!
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you go talk to, uh...
the teacher from<i> Ferris Bueller's Day Off?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>Ben Stein?
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>I'll bet that famously boring man
is a blast at parties. I'll be right back.
</p><timestamp>00:08:35</timestamp>
<p>-No, don't--
-Erica! Love the costume!
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>Where did you find such a hideous--?
Oh, my mistake, I'm so sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:08:41</timestamp>
<p>Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>Are you sure this is a good idea,
13-year-old Todd?
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>It's part of the Halloween Code.
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>If you don't give teenagers candy,
they're going to TP your house.
</p><timestamp>00:08:53</timestamp>
<p>Okay.

</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I've scoped out the party,
and I've yet to see a single mummy.
</p><timestamp>00:09:03</timestamp>
<p>As Margaret Thatcher's children
often asked,
</p><timestamp>00:09:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>imitating child</subtitle>
"Is Mummy coming to see us?"
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>normal</subtitle>
And as their nanny always replied,
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>British accent</subtitle> "Not tonight."
</p><timestamp>00:09:11</timestamp>
<p>-Thank god.
-<subtitle>normal voice</subtitle> I have to ask,
what is the deal with the mummies?
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p>Okay. I auditioned for<i> The Mummy</i> movie.
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>-The one with Brendan Fraser?
-Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:09:19</timestamp>
<p>And I thought everything was going well,
and then something
really traumatic happened.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God, what?
-I, uh... I didn't get the part.
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>That's it? You just didn't get it?
</p><timestamp>00:09:31</timestamp>
<p>I really wanted it!
And it still haunts me!
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>It's my one major career disappointment
as of 2004,
so could you please do me
this one thing
and make sure I don't see any mummies?
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>I promise. No mummies.
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p>Remember that time that lady
freaked out 'cause she saw a mummy?
</p><timestamp>00:09:45</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack and Pickles laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>-Who was that lady?
-Uh, that was actually Jessica Biel.
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p>Who? <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:51</timestamp>
<p>-One of my ex-wives?
-Oh, yeah!
</p><timestamp>00:09:53</timestamp>
<p>You've brought so many wives
and girlfriends to these parties,
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>-I cannot keep track.
-Well, don't forget about Pickles, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:09:59</timestamp>
<p>Uh, what? Why is the waitress here
talking about pickles?
</p><timestamp>00:10:02</timestamp>
<p>Somebody order pickles?
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>No, BoJack, this is my girlfriend.
Her name is Pickles.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>You can remember
because if you look at me,
and don't recall my name, you'll think,
</p><timestamp>00:10:10</timestamp>
<p>"Who is this person?
I'm in a real pickle!"
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>And then just know that my name
is like the thing that you're in,
but with an "S" at the end.
</p><timestamp>00:10:16</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-I'm Pickles!
</p><timestamp>00:10:18</timestamp>
<p>-My last name is Aplenty!
-Do I need to know this one?
</p><timestamp>00:10:21</timestamp>
<p>-Is she gonna be around for a while?
-<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:24</timestamp>
<p>I like that you're razzing me.
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>It really makes me feel
like one of the gang.
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>
<p>If he teases you, that means he likes you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:30</timestamp>

<p>Remember the year
that Pinky won the costume contest,
but then it turned out he'd just lost
all his belongings in a fire,
and those clothes were all that he owned?
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
-<subtitle>gulps</subtitle> That was classic!
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>

the costume contest.
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>Ow! My back! Why'd I do that?
</p><timestamp>00:10:51</timestamp>
<p>It sounds like
you all have a lot of history.
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I can't believe
we've been doing this party since '93.
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>

<p>Are you having fun?
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I'm having a great time explaining
my costume to people over and over again.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>Hey, here's a thought:
if you don't get someone's costume,
you don't need to tell them!
Just live your life!
</p><timestamp>00:11:17</timestamp>
<p>-Do you wanna leave?
-No, no, no, no! I'm fun!
</p><timestamp>00:11:20</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to leave! <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>

<p>Who has the yellow military
assault vehicle blocking me in?
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, that's me!
-Since when do you drive a Hummer?
</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>Company car.
I just like it 'cause it matches my hat.
</p><timestamp>00:11:33</timestamp>
<p>Plus, lots of room for the golf clubs,
and, boy, does that kitten purr.
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you take her out for a spin
and see how she handles?
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>What is his costume?
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>-Diane! Hi!
-Hey...
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>Am I on the hit Priscilla Barnes vehicle
<i>Three's Company</i> right now,
because three's company.
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>-I'm just trying to get out of here.
-Oh, my gosh, Diane,
</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>I just want you to know that I know
that you and Mister have a history...
</p><timestamp>00:11:57</timestamp>
<p>-"Mister?"
-And I'm fine with it,
and there's no reason we should be awkward
around each other, or jealous, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p>-I'm not jealous of you.
-Okay, good.
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>I'm not jealous of you either,
even though you are really intimidating.
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>But if we were jealous of each other,
that would be very normal,
so either way, it's totally cool.
Totally cool. <subtitle>hiccups</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p>Should we do shots together
to, like, celebrate
how normal we're being?
</p><timestamp>00:12:21</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, this is a good situation.
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>Okay, bye, Diane!
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>-Did I screw up? I'm so stupid.
-No. That's just Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>She doesn't like parties
and she hates fun.
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>-Oh!
-No, that's not fair. She used to be fun.
</p><timestamp>00:12:35</timestamp>
<p>In fact, when we first started dating,
my favorite thing about her was
that she was so much more fun
than my other ex-wives.
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>Oh, we're talking about your exes again!
That's great.
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>Of course, Jessica used to be fun, too.
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>That's why I started seeing her
after Katrina
because Katrina was so mean and cynical,
and Jessica was sweet and full of life.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, she sounds awesome.
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p>But, actually, now that I think about it,
when I first met Katrina,
she was also full of life.
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>Do you want another drink?
I'm going to get another drink.
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God. What a weird coincidence.
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p>Why do all these idealistic,
vivacious women eventually turn bitter
and cruel after being with me?
What's the common denominator?

<p>-What? But this party is so fun!
-It's not fun for me.
</p><timestamp>00:13:29</timestamp>
<p>'Cause I don't know anyone here.
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p>Of course you do. Just-- BoJack!
You remember my wife Katrina.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>-Huh? No, I do not.
-This is going great.
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>-I'm gonna go dry off. You two chat it up.

</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>Thank you for hosting this party.
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>So fun.
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>-What's the story on the hat?
-It's a Blossom costume.
</p><timestamp>00:13:50</timestamp>
<p>Oh, shit, that's right! It's Halloween.
I need a costume! Good call, stranger!
</p><timestamp>00:13:54</timestamp>
<p>Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>So, I love parties, as you know,
but maybe we should go soon?
</p><timestamp>00:14:01</timestamp>
<p>There are so many famous people here,
it's actually making me kind of anxious.
</p><timestamp>00:14:05</timestamp>
<p>Diane! Famous people are just
like you and me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:09</timestamp>
<p>Well, like me, because I am one.
</p><timestamp>00:14:11</timestamp>
<p>Mom? No, I can't talk right now.
Can I call you tomorrow?
</p><timestamp>00:14:14</timestamp>
<p>Or is this the one night a year
you emerge from your crypt?
</p><timestamp>00:14:16</timestamp>
<p>Go introduce yourself.
I'm sure he'd love to meet you!
</p><timestamp>00:14:19</timestamp>
<p>-Or we could just go home?
-No, come on.
</p><timestamp>00:14:22</timestamp>
<p>It's Halloween,
a night to face your fears.
</p><timestamp>00:14:24</timestamp>
<p>That's why they call it Halloween!
</p><timestamp>00:14:26</timestamp>
<p>So, you can wean yourself off
of having fears!

<p>I'm looking for the owner of a blue Tesla.

<p>And I don't wanna look stupid

<p>While you were gone,
Ben Stein introduced me to Tim Allen,
and the three of us had a long debate
about government spending,
which is exactly
how I wanted to spend my Halloween.
</p><timestamp>00:15:51</timestamp>
<p>-I am so sorry.
-Although, I have to say,
now that your TV show has put us
into a new tax bracket,
maybe we should start
paying attention more
to how the government is using our money.
</p><timestamp>00:16:00</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-No, I don't know, ya know,
</p><timestamp>00:16:02</timestamp>
<p>I'm just saying
that a true capitalist-free market
is actually, if you really think about it,
more fair than an arbitrary redistribution
based on need.

<p>I always thought that when this happened,
I would feel something.
</p><timestamp>00:20:08</timestamp>
<p>I don't know what, but something.
</p><timestamp>00:20:11</timestamp>
<p>But I don't feel anything.
What's wrong with me?
</p><timestamp>00:20:13</timestamp>
<p>Nothing's wrong.
Just sometimes parties are over.
</p><timestamp>00:20:17</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:18</timestamp>
<p>But... Hey, it doesn't have to be over.
</p><timestamp>00:20:21</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I could stick around
for a little bit.
</p><timestamp>00:20:23</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, sure, good idea.
Stick around for as long as you want.
</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>
<p>Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:20:37</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry I ruined
another Halloween for you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:39</timestamp>
<p>-You didn't ruin it.
-I really wanted you to think I was fun.
</p><timestamp>00:20:42</timestamp>
<p>Diane, you don't need to pretend
to be something you're not.
</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>-I already love you.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>And I'm going to love you,
no matter what version of you you are.
</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>So, you might as well give me
the real version.
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>This is good.
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>Now I know you don't like parties.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>So, we will never have
that argument again.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>I really humiliated myself
in front of BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>engine</subtitle>
-If it makes you feel better,
</p><timestamp>00:21:07</timestamp>
<p>I guarantee BoJack won't even remember
that he met you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>Okay, new strategy.
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>I'm looking for four
strong construction workers
who can lift my car
and carry it out to the street,
like in the Mentos commercial.
Any takers?
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Peanutbutter</subtitle> Open the door!
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Pickles</subtitle> Just leave me alone!
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>What's going on in there?
Tough SAT prep course?
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>Fail her learner's permit test?
</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>Skirmish with the members
of the <i>Baby-Sitter's Club?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>-Nope.
-Shattered dreams of playing Adelaide
in her high school's production
of<i> Guys and Dolls</i>
because the musical director sees her
as more of a Rusty Charlie?
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>I don't know why this keeps happening.
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>I take these amazing women,
like Pickles, like you,
</p><timestamp>00:21:44</timestamp>
<p>Katrina, Jessica, and I ruin them.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>I'm not <i>ruined.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p>-No, I just mean... I don't listen.
-Okay, yes.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>It is definitely very annoying
how you don't listen.
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>Thank you, but you don't have to say
nice things just to make me feel better.
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>
<p>Huh? Okay, no.
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>I was going to say you not listening
and I repeat, you don't listen,
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>-that's not the only thing going on here.
-There are more things?
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>-What do all these women have in common?
-They're mean?
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>-When you first start dating them.
-They're fun?
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>They're young.
You keep dating women in their 20s.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>I do, do that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>They're not fully-formed yet.
Life changes people.
</p><timestamp>00:22:23</timestamp>
<p>-Well, not me.
-That's kind of my point.
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>You don't ruin these women,
they just grow up.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>So, what you're saying is...
they all grow up, but I stay the same age?
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>All right. All right. All right.
How do I fix that?
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>Well, either you date someone older...
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p><i>-Ooooooor...</i>
-Or, you grow up.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>Because otherwise,
they're gonna keep outgrowing you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>
<p>Mind if I try?
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>Okay, first thing we need to do
is sit you up and get you hydrated.
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>Thanks.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>I understand what you're going through.
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>I've been in your position before,
and this party is hard.
</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>hiccups</subtitle> It is!
</p><timestamp>00:23:07</timestamp>
<p>It's hard to be the new girlfriend.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>And to be at a famous person's house,
at an event with 25 years of history,
and all these people
Mr. Peanutbutter has known for years.
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>hiccups</subtitle> Plus, you're here.
-Plus, I'm here.
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p>-What if I'm just a rebound?
-Mm.
</p><timestamp>00:23:23</timestamp>
<p>I was a rebound.
And he loved me, so much, for ten years.
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>If there's one thing I know
about him,
it's that he loves the person he's with
deeply and unconditionally.
</p><timestamp>00:23:33</timestamp>
<p>So, you don't have to worry about me,
because I'm not that person anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p>-You are.
-Aw. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>door opens</subtitle>
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Pickles sighs</subtitle>
-If you guys will excuse me,
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>I'm just gonna take
this dickhole's helicopter home.
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>I'm actually really glad you went through
all those ex-wives
because it means
I got the best version of you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:55</timestamp>
<p>-That's right. Version 4.0.
-Oh! I like the sound of that.
</p><timestamp>00:23:59</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you wanna just go home?
Hang out, just the two of us?
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>Psh! No way! I just saw on Tweed Feed
that Josephine's ex, Tor,
is throwing a monster shindig up in NoHo.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>Who-sephine's ex-what now?
</p><timestamp>00:24:09</timestamp>
<p>They have a two-story ice luge,
and a huge beer pond tournament.
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>And I brought new costumes,
so we don't have to look stupid wearing
the same in all our pictures.
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:17</timestamp>
<p>I never wanna grow up!
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:20</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Where's everybody going?
It's Halloween!
</p><timestamp>00:24:23</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groaning</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>door opens</subtitle> Happy Hallowee-- What the?
</p><timestamp>00:24:31</timestamp>
<p>-Where is everyone?
-Hey, let's do this again next year.
</p><timestamp>00:24:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm going to bed.
</p><timestamp>00:24:38</timestamp>
<p>I love Halloween.
