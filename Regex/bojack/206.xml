<p>As your accountant,
I felt it necessary to do this in person.
</p><timestamp>00:00:14</timestamp>
<p>Us, too. Because we're really
accounting on you...
</p><timestamp>00:00:16</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-to get in on the ground floor of this...
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>No, don't do this. Please, God, no.

<p>...PB Livin' product.
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>Has this ever happened to you?
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>Whatever it is, it hasn't happened.
Nothing has ever happened to me.
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>-You say you love a toasted bagel.
-I would never say that.
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>-I have celiac disease.
-Ding. Bagel's ready.
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>-But wait.
-Son of a--
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>-Hey. That bagel was too fast.
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>That's why PB Livin' presents,
the Bagel Catcher.
</p><timestamp>00:00:41</timestamp>
<p>-For all those hard-to-catch bagels.
-No, no. Stop. Enough. Enough.
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>Stop talking! I can't take it anymore!
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>PB Livin' is filing for bankruptcy.
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>-I'm shutting you down.
-I thought you were a customer.
</p><timestamp>00:00:52</timestamp>
<p>I don't get what's happening.
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>What's happening is you two knuckleheads
threw thousands of dollars
into a bunch of dumb ideas.
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>You paid 50 grand
to a bunch of kindergartners
for the movie rights
to the game "tag."
</p><timestamp>00:01:05</timestamp>
<p>Our business manager
was over the moon for that.
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p>Business manager?
Who the hell is your business manager?
</p><timestamp>00:01:10</timestamp>
<p>Business-wise, this all seems
like appropriate business.
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>You two are done.
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>This company is more in the red
than <i>Carrie </i>on prom night.
</p><timestamp>00:01:20</timestamp>
<p>So, what you're saying is, we're just
one great idea away from breaking even?
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p>No. You're-- <subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
You are out of money.
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter,
you need to get a job.
</p><timestamp>00:01:31</timestamp>
<p>-Are you hiring at your accounting firm?
-Dude, no.
</p><timestamp>00:01:39</timestamp>
<p>I'm waiting for my agent.
He'll be with me any moment.
</p><timestamp>00:01:42</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter is going back to work.
</p><timestamp>00:01:45</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. He's probably just organizing
all the amazing opportunities.
</p><timestamp>00:01:49</timestamp>
<p>I haven't heard from him in years,
so they've probably been piling up.
</p><timestamp>00:01:53</timestamp>
<p>Maybe I should just go check on him.
</p><timestamp>00:01:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>knocking on door</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:56</timestamp>
<p>Hello, Ronnie? It's your favorite client,
Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:02:00</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm coming in. I hope you're--
Oh! Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:02:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ronnie, how'd you get that belt
around your neck,
</p><timestamp>00:02:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}then caught on the filing cabinet,
which made your pants fall down
</p><timestamp>00:02:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}while you were researching pornograph--
Oh, I see what happened here.

<p>{\an8}Here's a thing written on a card.
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>Last night, major Hollywoo agent Ronnie
Bonito was found dead in his office...
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>Ruh-roh.
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>...in what authorities are calling
a mishap of a sexual nature.
</p><timestamp>00:03:24</timestamp>
<p>-What does that mean?
-You know, auto-erotic asphyxiation.
</p><timestamp>00:03:28</timestamp>
<p>Auto-a-what's it who's it?
</p><timestamp>00:03:30</timestamp>
<p>Oh, is that that thing
where you strangle yourself
in an attempt to heighten
sexual arousal?
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p>It sure is.

</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Did you hear that? New food truck.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-We should go.
-I'm in.
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>Hey, can I get some lunch money?
It's pizza day today.
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>Sure thing, sport.
Wait, where is it pizza day?
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>-In my tummy.
-Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hey, BoJack, would you zip me up?
My shoulder is killing me.
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm not sleeping right.
We need to do something about that bed.
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p>Just because I'm nocturnal
doesn't mean I wanna be up all night.
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I propped it up with a Golden Globe.
-It still wobbles.
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Yeah. Anyway, I got you something.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>A beeper? BoJack, it's great,
but you know, I already have one.
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't.
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>Now, you can page me
whenever you want.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>Huh. BoJack, I love it,
and you're gonna love it, too.
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p>There's all kinds of codes
we can send each other.
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>"Zero, zero, zero" is "call me,"
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and "1-2-3" is "I miss you"
and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.
</p><timestamp>00:04:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What? Boobs? Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What scamp came up with that one?
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Okay, I gotta go. Dinner tonight?
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Totally. Let's hit that gravy truck.
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Okay, love you.

<p>{\an8}Rutabaga, this day already sucks.
</p><timestamp>00:05:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}My heel broke
while I was at this new food truck,
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and I spilled a handful of gravy
all over myself
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}because they don't sell bowls,
just gravy.
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Should've gone to the bowl truck first.
That's where they get you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, I guess the upside to being
invisible around here
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}is that none of these assholes
will ever notice what a mess I am.
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I see what a mess you are.
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Aw...
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Do you need the movie-star speech?
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No, no, I'll be okay.
And how are you?
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>Gotta look at paint for the new kitchen.
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>I have to pick a shade that won't clash
with the splatter of blood
from when I blow my brains out
after talking to Katie
about paint swatches all day. <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>We do have fun.
</p><timestamp>00:06:10</timestamp>
<p>So, what's the plan for today?
Find a new agent, go on auditions?
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed me
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House, </i>oh, so long ago.
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>Wander around L.A. with an open mind
and an empty stomach
until I get discovered.
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>But also, like, find a new agent
and go on auditions, right?
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>Or should I start stealing food
from work?
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>I'm just gonna go with the flow
and leave everything up to destiny.
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>-Que sera quesadilla.
-You know we could lose the house, right?
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Diane.
-Right?
</p><timestamp>00:06:36</timestamp>
<p>Diane, Diane, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>door opens then closes</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>-Diane.
-Aah!
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>I wasn't stealing paper towels
to use as dinner napkins. Why?
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p>Here's a funny question for you:
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p>If Mr. Peanutbutter said,
"I love you. No, I don't,"
would you need to talk about that later
and figure out what he meant?
</p><timestamp>00:07:00</timestamp>
<p>Probably not, right?
Because they're meaningless words?
</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p>I mean, language evolves, right?
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>How can anyone know
what anything means?
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>The answer is nobody can.
Nothing means anything.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>So why bother talking about anything?
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>In this scenario, are Mr. Peanutbutter
and I living in our house?
</p><timestamp>00:07:13</timestamp>
<p>Or are we squatting in an abandoned
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble burning books to keep warm
as we struggle through
our Dickensian-style poverty?
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>beeper plays ringtone</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>"Zero, zero, zero."
No idea what that means.
</p><timestamp>00:07:24</timestamp>
<p>I think it means "call me."
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>Ignore. Wait, where's the ignore button?
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>How do I ignore?
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>I think with a beeper, you just ignore it.
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>-With what, my mind?
-You seem a little stressed out.
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p>That's because
as soon as I'm done with work,
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>I have to have a long,
awkward conversation
with Wanda about our relationship,
unless... I'm never done with work.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>Diane, you magnificent bastard. That's it.
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>I'll be out there in the stands.
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>And I'll be rooting for you, Secretariat.
</p><timestamp>00:07:57</timestamp>
<p>Mm. Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>Your line is,
"And I'll see you at the finish line."
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I know. I'm acting.
Great. Now I gotta start all over.
</p><timestamp>00:08:11</timestamp>
<p>Settle in, folks.
We could be here a while.
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>-Ow! Ooh.
-Ah, Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>So good of you to join us eventually.
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>Sorry I'm late. I had the worst morning.
</p><timestamp>00:08:24</timestamp>
<p>You know who had an even
"the worst-er" morning?
</p><timestamp>00:08:26</timestamp>
<p>-Ronnie Bonito. Because he's dead.
-He is?
</p><timestamp>00:08:29</timestamp>
<p>He decided to strangle the dirty dangle
and now that sweet chariot
has come for to carry him home.
</p><timestamp>00:08:35</timestamp>
<p>Everyone who was here on time
is taking a moment.
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>-Of silence?
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>Also to reach out to his former clients.
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>-To offer their condolences?
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>Also to recruit them to the Vigor roster.
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>-A Vigor agent is a vigorous agent.
-Who do you want me to call?
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>I have ins with a bunch of Bonito's
clients including all the major J's:
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>-Law, Lo, Leno, and J. Abrams.
-Oh, that's wonderful news
in the parallel universe
in which you were on time today.
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>In this reality, however, we're all good.
</p><timestamp>00:09:08</timestamp>
<p>You can lap up the leftovers though.
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>-"Mr. Peanutbutter"?
-Oh, and Princess Carolyn?
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>Get your shoe fixed.
</p><timestamp>00:09:15</timestamp>
<p>You look like a woman

</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Hitting the pavement.
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>This is how it happens for a guy like me.
</p><timestamp>00:09:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunts</subtitle> Ew...
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>Out of my way, flyer.
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be
on my shoe in front of this store?
</p><timestamp>00:09:51</timestamp>
<p>Wait, a second. Shoe.
</p><timestamp>00:09:53</timestamp>
<p>Store.
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>Shoe store? Shoe store.
</p><timestamp>00:09:58</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:09:59</timestamp>

<p>I make all the other team players
look like garbage.

line.
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>Great, we got it. We got one take.
</p><timestamp>00:10:22</timestamp>
<p>And now we gotta stop for the day.
</p><timestamp>00:10:24</timestamp>
<p>What? No. Why stop now?
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>-I'm just getting warmed up.
-Union rules. We're done. Go home.
</p><timestamp>00:10:29</timestamp>
<p>Go home?
</p><timestamp>00:10:30</timestamp>
<p>Why go home when we could extend
this long day's journey into night?
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>-Drinks on me, folks.
-I could use a drink.
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>-Or six.
-Great, Corduroy's driving. Let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:10:42</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Corduroy</subtitle> Ah...
</p><timestamp>00:10:43</timestamp>
<p>-I really needed this, BoJack.
-Me, too.
</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, man.
This day's been really hard on me.
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>Ever since I heard about that agent
who died from that blue-face blastoff?
</p><timestamp>00:10:51</timestamp>
<p>-Blue-face blastoff?
-The strokey chokey?
</p><timestamp>00:10:53</timestamp>
<p>-The two-neck squeeze?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>You know, the one hand
on the Adam's apple,
the other one's
on the Adam's banana?
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>Oh, right. Right. Yeah. The auto-erotic--
</p><timestamp>00:11:02</timestamp>
<p>That could've been me.
I used to really be into that stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:11:05</timestamp>
<p>I was a hardcore gasper.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>Can't believe you have
so many names for it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>Now I can't stop thinking about it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:10</timestamp>
<p>I shouldn't even be alive right now.
</p><timestamp>00:11:12</timestamp>
<p>Don't need to talk about
how you masturbate.
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>-The orgasms you get--
-Okay, I guess we do.
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p>It's like seeing a rainbow,
but with all the colors.
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>-So, like a normal rainbow?
-But it's too dangerous, man.
</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>
<p>They say if you bite down on a lemon
right at the point of climax,
the lemon juice gives you the jolt
you need to not pass out and die.
</p><timestamp>00:11:28</timestamp>
<p>But still man,
you're just... rolling the dice.
</p><timestamp>00:11:33</timestamp>
<p>Okay, this is getting really graphic.
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>Can we maybe
talk about anything else?
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>-Sure.
-Thank God.
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>Hey, man, it's funny you should mention
God, because my new thing is... the Bible.
</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>Tell me, have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your Lord and personal savior?
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>So, noose-wise, what are we talking?
You use a standard sailor's knot
or more like your average
birthday-present bow?
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunting softly</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p>-I beeped you, BoJack.
-Oh, hey. About this morning--
</p><timestamp>00:12:06</timestamp>
<p>-It's fine.
-Because when I said that--
</p><timestamp>00:12:08</timestamp>
<p>I said it's fine. You don't love me.
</p><timestamp>00:12:10</timestamp>
<p>That's okay. I don't love you.
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Good night.
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>upbeat theme music playing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>in unison</subtitle>
Morning time, Hollywoo.
</p><timestamp>00:12:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
-And I'm Some Lady.
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}On today's show,
I sit down with Hank Hippopopalous
to discuss his new smash hit,
<i>Hey, I Think You Can Dance.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>Can you talk about your process?
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}When I see someone,
and I think they can dance,
</p><timestamp>00:12:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I say,
"Hey, I think you can dance."
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>And when I think they can't dance,
I say, "No, I don't think you can dance."
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p><i>-And that is pretty much it.</i>
<i>-Fascinating.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>-So, last night when--
-BoJack, it's not a big deal.
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>You don't love me, I don't love you.
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>We're having a good time. It's fine.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>Can't just say, "I don't love you"
to someone.
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p>-You said it to me.
-Yeah, but that was different.
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p>-How was that different?
-Because you do love me. Right?
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>-Like a little bit?
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>Uh, for what it's worth,
I love both you guys.
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p>Shut up, Todd. Grown-ups are talking.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>Here you go, ma'am.
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>women laughing and chattering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>Jessica Atkinson, come on down.
</p><timestamp>00:13:19</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:13:21</timestamp>
<p>Would you like to see what's in
box number one or box number two?
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>Either way,
it's a brand-new pair of shoes!
</p><timestamp>00:13:29</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>women clapping and laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>Hup. Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>-Rutabaga--
-Coffee?
</p><timestamp>00:13:38</timestamp>
<p>I was thinking about you last night
while Katie and I were locked in a
fascinating debate about counter granite.
</p><timestamp>00:13:44</timestamp>
<p>And what if I told you I used to work
Ronnie Bonito's desk,
and I happen to know
that he had a client so hush-hush,
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>-it wasn't even on the master list.
-What? Who? Tell me. Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>alarm ringing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>Beloved novelist J.D. Salinger. What?
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>The author of <i>Catcher in the Rye?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>-And... others?
-Yuh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:14:05</timestamp>
<p>-Isn't he dead?
-He's "reclusive."
</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>
<p>Dude wanted to be left alone so much,
he faked his own death.
</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:14:13</timestamp>
<p>Why are you giving this lead to me?
</p><timestamp>00:14:15</timestamp>
<p>-Because I like you, dummy.
-Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:14:18</timestamp>
<p>Now we gotta wait for the fire department
to come let us out of this elevator.
</p><timestamp>00:14:26</timestamp>
<p>-Hey.
-Corduroy, what are you doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p>I need a favor.
Can you hold on to this for me?
</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p>-Ew. Is this your Bible?
-No, no, no.
</p><timestamp>00:14:33</timestamp>
<p>-It's my choking-off kit.
-Your kit?
</p><timestamp>00:14:35</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. It has all my supplies.
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>Silk ties, a leather gag, velvet sock.
Lemon.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>You gotta take this off my hands.
I can't trust myself with this.
</p><timestamp>00:14:42</timestamp>
<p>I don't know if I want
your jack-off kit at my house.
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>Please. I got this girlfriend.
She loves me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>If I fall back into the old gasp-and-goo,
it'll break her heart.
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>
<p>Wait. So, you're saying
if someone loves you,
they don't want you to choke yourself
while masturbating?
</p><timestamp>00:14:55</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. It's really dangerous.
</p><timestamp>00:14:57</timestamp>
<p>-All right. I'll take it.
-Thanks, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>I still don't understand
why you need a kit.
</p><timestamp>00:15:02</timestamp>
<p>Can't you just use,
like, a belt or a rope?
</p><timestamp>00:15:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I guess.
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I guess you could use anything.
</p><timestamp>00:15:08</timestamp>
<p>I mean, you could use an iPhone charger,
a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope...
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Carolyn</subtitle> Hm...
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Ooh.
</p><timestamp>00:15:25</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, hello. I'm looking for some--
-Sorry, no looking allowed.
</p><timestamp>00:15:28</timestamp>
<p>This store is for customers only.
</p><timestamp>00:15:30</timestamp>
<p>Okay, then, I would like to buy a bicycle.
What would you recommend?
</p><timestamp>00:15:34</timestamp>
<p>-One with a bell, or--?
-You got me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:36</timestamp>
<p>I don't know anything about bicycles.
I'm J.D. Salinger. I faked my own death.
</p><timestamp>00:15:40</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Salinger. Such a pleasure.
Princess Carolyn, big fan.
</p><timestamp>00:15:45</timestamp>
<p>Let me guess, <i>Catcher in the Rye?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:15:47</timestamp>
<p>And others.
</p><timestamp>00:15:49</timestamp>
<p>-I wanna say <i>The Hobbi--</i>
-Nope.
</p><timestamp>00:15:51</timestamp>
<p>Look. I'm an agent.
</p><timestamp>00:15:53</timestamp>
<p>It doesn't matter
whether I've read your work.
</p><timestamp>00:15:55</timestamp>
<p>What matters is I can look you
in the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.
</p><timestamp>00:15:59</timestamp>
<p>The world is ready for your comeback,
and I wanna help.
</p><timestamp>00:16:02</timestamp>
<p>No, thank you. Not interested.
</p><timestamp>00:16:04</timestamp>
<p>Did that before, didn't work out well.
</p><timestamp>00:16:06</timestamp>
<p>Fans were relentless.
The critics were cruel.
</p><timestamp>00:16:08</timestamp>
<p>And that's why my motto is,
"It's better to be alone."
</p><timestamp>00:16:11</timestamp>
<p>Which, come to think of it,
is probably why I don't sell
a lot of tandem bicycles.
</p><timestamp>00:16:16</timestamp>
<p>But, J.D. Salinger,
you are J.D. Salinger.
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>You are a goddamn American treasure.
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>But every time I go out in the world,
people hound me about my books.
</p><timestamp>00:16:24</timestamp>
<p>Well, book.
</p><timestamp>00:16:26</timestamp>
<p>What if I told you there was a place
where no one reads books?
</p><timestamp>00:16:29</timestamp>
<p>I'm listening.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>A place where people only read
headlines, lists and pictures.
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p>A place where people
hate reading so much,
they hire others to do it for them
and don't even pay a living wage.
</p><timestamp>00:16:39</timestamp>
<p>What do you mean,
like, modern reading slaves?
</p><timestamp>00:16:42</timestamp>
<p>Exactly.
</p><timestamp>00:16:44</timestamp>
<p>And all those modern reading slaves
really wanna be doing
is writing things that, one day,
other people will also avoid reading.
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>-Does such a place truly exist?
-Come with me, J.D. Salinger.
</p><timestamp>00:16:54</timestamp>
<p>Let's go to Hollywoo.
</p><timestamp>00:17:02</timestamp>
<p>Hup!
</p><timestamp>00:17:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:07</timestamp>
<p>-Hey.
-Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:17:09</timestamp>
<p>-We need to talk.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:17:11</timestamp>
<p>You're probably wondering
what this beautiful mahogany box is.
</p><timestamp>00:17:14</timestamp>
<p>-I wasn't wondering that.
-It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.
</p><timestamp>00:17:17</timestamp>
<p>I've decided to do the funky Spider-Man.
</p><timestamp>00:17:20</timestamp>
<p>-What? Funky Spider-Man?
-I came up with that one myself.
</p><timestamp>00:17:22</timestamp>
<p>Because he hangs,
then he shoots webbing.
</p><timestamp>00:17:24</timestamp>
<p>Wait. Are you saying you want to
auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself?
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>Yes. I do.
</p><timestamp>00:17:29</timestamp>
<p>Even though it's very dangerous
</p><timestamp>00:17:31</timestamp>
<p>-and I could die.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>Now, if you love me, you probably
wouldn't want me to do it.
</p><timestamp>00:17:36</timestamp>
<p>-Okay. I get it.
-Since you don't, I should do it, right?
</p><timestamp>00:17:39</timestamp>
<p>I mean, there's no reason not to...
unless you love me.
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>-Do it.
-Wait. Seriously?
</p><timestamp>00:17:44</timestamp>
<p>Seems like you've already
made up your mind.
</p><timestamp>00:17:46</timestamp>
<p>If you're that set on it,
knock yourself out.
</p><timestamp>00:17:48</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Only if I do it wrong.
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>Because as I mentioned before,
it's very dangerous.
</p><timestamp>00:17:53</timestamp>
<p>-Have fun.
-I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.
</p><timestamp>00:17:56</timestamp>
<p>Great. Put a towel down.
Not one of the good ones.

<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> <i>Oh, my. Ooh, wow.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:18:15</timestamp>
<p>Oh, hey. Look who survived
to masturbate another day.
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.
</p><timestamp>00:18:20</timestamp>
<p>If I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna go all out.
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p>A big job like that needs lumber,
and pulleys, lemons, so forth.
</p><timestamp>00:18:25</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna half-ass anything.
This is my orgasm we're talking about.
</p><timestamp>00:18:29</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.
</p><timestamp>00:18:31</timestamp>
<p>-Not too late to stop me.
-I'm not gonna stop you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>-Good 'cause don't.
-All right, we're in agreement.
</p><timestamp>00:18:36</timestamp>
<p>Stop fighting!
</p><timestamp>00:18:37</timestamp>
<p>Can't you two see
what this is doing to me?
</p><timestamp>00:18:39</timestamp>
<p>I've been acting out. <subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:43</timestamp>
<p>Have a great day.
</p><timestamp>00:18:45</timestamp>
<p>Todd? Get in the car.
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p>It's time to get serious
about auto-erotic asphyxiation.
</p><timestamp>00:18:49</timestamp>
<p>Hooray! Question mark?
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>
<p>Just play it cool, Todd.
No one needs to know why we're here.
</p><timestamp>00:18:59</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me, I'm looking for something
that will hold up a lot of weight.
</p><timestamp>00:19:03</timestamp>
<p>Let's say something that could hoist up
a horse comfortably by the neck.
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p>Not for suicide purposes.
</p><timestamp>00:19:09</timestamp>
<p>I'm trying to have
a more fulfilling orgasm.
</p><timestamp>00:19:15</timestamp>
<p>The world wept when news broke
that J.D. Salinger died.
</p><timestamp>00:19:19</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle> J.D. Salinger died?
-But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasps</subtitle> J.D. Salinger didn't die?
</p><timestamp>00:19:25</timestamp>
<p>As one of the 20th century's
most celebrated authors,
</p><timestamp>00:19:28</timestamp>
<p>J.D. Salinger has inspired
countless dreamers,
eighth graders
and occasionally, assassins.
</p><timestamp>00:19:33</timestamp>
<p>His spare lyricism
and devotion to character
will undoubtedly translate into
a penetrating dramatic work for this,
the golden age of television writing.
</p><timestamp>00:19:42</timestamp>
<p>J.D. Take it away.
</p><timestamp>00:19:44</timestamp>
<p>I wanna do a show where people
ask celebrities trivia questions.
</p><timestamp>00:19:48</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Like a game show?
</p><timestamp>00:19:50</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. You know because
since they're famous people,
</p><timestamp>00:19:52</timestamp>
<p>I think normal people would wanna see
if they know trivia and stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>You know, like, Hollywoo stars
and celebrities, what do they know?
</p><timestamp>00:20:00</timestamp>
<p>Do they know things? Let's find out.
</p><timestamp>00:20:02</timestamp>
<p>What a hoot. I love it, and I don't
use that word with just anybody.
</p><timestamp>00:20:05</timestamp>
<p>What do you call it?
</p><timestamp>00:20:06</timestamp>
<p>I call it <i>Hollywoo Stars and</i>
<i>Celebrities: What Do They Know?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p><i>Do They Know Things?</i>
<i>Let's Find Out.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:12</timestamp>
<p>It's maybe more of a working title.
</p><timestamp>00:20:14</timestamp>
<p>I can see it on the marquee already.
</p><timestamp>00:20:16</timestamp>
<p>-Must be a long marquee.
-It's long.
</p><timestamp>00:20:18</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah. The celebrities
can also do physical challenges.
</p><timestamp>00:20:21</timestamp>
<p>Oh, it's perfect.
</p><timestamp>00:20:22</timestamp>
<p>We've been searching for a companion
for <i>Hey, I Think You Can Dance.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:25</timestamp>
<p>But wait, wait one second.
Who's gonna host?
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>Huh. I've got the perfect guy.
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p>Who wants to be in Nike Airs?
</p><timestamp>00:20:34</timestamp>
<p>Claire, you are looking off the charts
"gorge" in those tennis shoes.
</p><timestamp>00:20:37</timestamp>
<p>But let me ask you this:
Would you like to buy a towel?
</p><timestamp>00:20:42</timestamp>
<p>Because I'm throwing one in for free.
</p><timestamp>00:20:44</timestamp>
<p>-He's perfect.
-<subtitle>Wanda</subtitle> Mm-hm.
</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:20:48</timestamp>
<p>How would you like to be the host of
J.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?
</p><timestamp>00:20:53</timestamp>
<p>What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.
</p><timestamp>00:20:56</timestamp>
<p>You know, it just goes to show,
with the right attitude,
every single one of your dreams
will always come true.
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>And if your dreams don't come true,
it's probably because you just
didn't have the right attitude.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>Today, one agent did something
that no one else could.
</p><timestamp>00:21:15</timestamp>
<p>I'll give you two hints: catcher and rye.
</p><timestamp>00:21:18</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>Charley Witherspoon caught a rye bagel
coming out of the toaster.
</p><timestamp>00:21:24</timestamp>
<p>-Come again?
-It was coming fast and hot.
</p><timestamp>00:21:27</timestamp>
<p>One day, some genius will invent
some sort of bagel catcher
that takes the guesswork out of this task,
but until then, Charley gets a gold star.
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p>-Thanks, Dad. I mean, Mr. Dad.
-Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>Oh, boy.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>Still alive? Because auto-erotic
asphyxiation is so risky?
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>Well, here I am, for now.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>BoJack... Wait.
Did you fix the bed?
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I was at the hardware store
picking up supplies for my auto-erotic
asphyxiation machine.
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>Because, as you are aware,
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>I'm preparing to auto-erotic
asphyxiate myself.
</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p>Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you
could at least get a good night's sleep.
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>Okay, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>Wanna talk about
the elephant in the room?
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>Wow. Okay. You know what?
</p><timestamp>00:22:17</timestamp>
<p>You know what? Here's-- First of all--
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>Wow. All right, I can't even-- <subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>You know what? I-- <subtitle>scoffs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p>Wow.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>He is never gonna forget that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>What is this all about?
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>This isn't about anything but
the pursuit of the kind of orgasm
that feels like a rainbow
with every color.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>-So, a regular rainbow.
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:22:38</timestamp>
<p>So, if you don't mind,
as long as you don't love me,
</p><timestamp>00:22:41</timestamp>
<p>I have a noose to step into.
<subtitle>clears throat</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>I just need to release this lever,
drop these bags of sand,
which act as counterweights,
and then just pull this nozzle.
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>-Perfect.
-Okay. Have fun.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>-Wait, Wanda. <subtitle>grunting and choking</subtitle>
-Okay, fine, you stupid baby.
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>I love you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>I-- <subtitle>coughs</subtitle> I knew it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>But I'm not going to tell you
not to do the funky Spider-Man.
</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>coughs</subtitle> What?
-You need to be responsible for yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>-That doesn't sound like me.
-I know.
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>But if you love me, too,
you won't do it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:13</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasps then grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:17</timestamp>
<p>-I thought so.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>Just for the record, I never really
wanted to do this in the first place,
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>Me not doing it
is not a sign that I love you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>-It's just because I'm a coward.
-<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>-I don't love you.
-Sure, you don't.
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>
<p>I don't. Come back here.
I don't love you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p>You don't make me feel less broken.
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p>I don't get it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>I singlehandedly got a Lady Footlocker
store employee a primetime show
and resurrected a certified dead man
and nobody cared.
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>-Why do I do anything?
-<subtitle>Rutabaga over phone</subtitle> <i>Hey.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>Do you need the movie star speech?
</p><timestamp>00:23:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
Carolyn, you are the star of a movie.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>This is the part of the movie
where you get your heart broken.
</p><timestamp>00:24:01</timestamp>
<p><i>Where the world tests you,</i>
<i>and people treat you like shit.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:24:03</timestamp>
<p>But it has to happen this way.
</p><timestamp>00:24:05</timestamp>
<p>Otherwise, the end of the movie,
when you get everything you want,
won't feel as rewarding.
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p>There are assholes out there,
but in the end, they don't matter.
</p><timestamp>00:24:14</timestamp>
<p><i>Because this movie's not about them.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:24:16</timestamp>
<p><i>It's never been about them.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>
<p><i>All this time, the movie's been about you.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p>Thanks.
</p><timestamp>00:24:24</timestamp>
<p>-Carolyn?
-Yes, Rutabaga?
</p><timestamp>00:24:27</timestamp>
<p>I think Katie and I are getting a divorce.
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>Corduroy? I don't want this thing anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:24:34</timestamp>
<p>Corduroy?
</p><timestamp>00:24:36</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you decent, man?
