<xml><title>A Little Uneven, Is All - BoJack Horseman</title><body>    <timestamp>00:00:09</timestamp>
<p>In my line of work,
I meet a lot of big names.
</p><timestamp>00:00:11</timestamp>
<p>I'm talking the sexiest guys of the '90s:
Nick Nolte. Mickey Rourke...
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>Literally, here we are in the '90s,
and these are the guys
we think are sexy, right?
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>And my daughter couldn't care less.
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>But when I told her
I was meeting BoJack Horseman...
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>Do me a favor. Make her day.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>Me? I didn't ask for this gig.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>Angela Diaz,
head of the network, calls me,
working schmuck, Danny Bananas,
and says, "Danny, Herb Kazzaz is leavin',
and I want you to run <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>So, here's me, thinking,
"What an opportunity
to write for the most finely-calibrated
ensemble cast on television!"
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>It's like a bowling alley
with you people.
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p>Setting up pins and knocking them down.
I should be so lucky.
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>-Uh.
-I know it's no secret
that you and Herb had some friction,
and he left the show
under not-great circumstances.
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>Now I'm coming at this from a place of...
this is your house,
and I'm a guest, all right?
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>The magic of <i>Horsin' Around</i>
is not Herb Kazzaz or Danny Bananas.
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>I know why people buy the Big Mac.
I'm not here to change the recipe.
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p>You're the special sauce, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:01:09</timestamp>
<p>Me? I just wanna be the bun.
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>And not even the top or the bottom bun.
I'm fine being the middle bun.
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>-You already told me this story.
-I did?
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Danny. Sharona. The buns.
We've been over it.
</p><timestamp>00:01:20</timestamp>
<p>-Well, did I tell you about Gina?
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:01:22</timestamp>
<p>-And Sarah Lynn?
-Multiple times. Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p>-What about the time I sneezed on Marisa?
-You've told me everything.
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>You told me about that dream
where you go to a dinner party.
</p><timestamp>00:01:30</timestamp>
<p>I even went down
that strange detour with you
about the three-nippled woman in
the nudie magazine your uncle showed you.
</p><timestamp>00:01:35</timestamp>
<p>-Who was she?
-I think we're done here.
</p><timestamp>00:01:38</timestamp>
<p>-What do you mean, done?
-Well, you've been here six months.
</p><timestamp>00:01:41</timestamp>
<p>It's time to go home.

<p>{\an8}My boss is gonna kill me
if I don't deliver these flowers
to his mistress.
</p><timestamp>00:02:44</timestamp>
<p>Well, we're filming
an episode of <i>Birthday Dad,</i>
and my boss is gonna kill me
if I let anyone through.
</p><timestamp>00:02:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Great, when they discover my remains
scattered in the bramble of Griffith Park,
</p><timestamp>00:02:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}my loved ones will take solace
knowing I died
</p><timestamp>00:02:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so they could shoot an episode
of <i>Birthday Dad.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:58</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. It's a really good show!
</p><timestamp>00:03:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I know I couldn't always be there for you,
birthday-wise, but I'd like to be.
</p><timestamp>00:03:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'd like to be your Birthday Dad.
</p><timestamp>00:03:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You really don't get it, do you?
This is the real world, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And I'm a career gal.
I don't have time for birthdays.
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But what about the birthday spirit?
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Everyone knows there's no such thing.
This is the real world.
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to drink my coffee.
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>

<p>{\an8}-Yes, that would be-- Ooh!

</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Oops.

<p>{\an8}Donna, we're gonna need another scarf.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Am I crazy, or has the crew turned on you?
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>No, what they're turned onto
is hating me...
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}on account of I cheated on Pickles.
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ever since the story went viral,
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}the public has really mashed
the thumbs down on old Peanurino.
</p><timestamp>00:03:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Especially young women.
-Oh, no!
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"Especially young women"
is one of our show's eight target demos.
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>We gotta juice your Q!
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>Right now, the only juice
I'm interested in is Pickles' juice
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and making things kosher between us,
which is a task I relish.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>-So, you wanna have sex with me?
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>And your fianc√©
is gonna be in there watching, or...
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>
<p>This is not a fetish-based
cuckolding scenario.
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>He had sex with his ex, so to level
the playing field now, we have to boink,
so Mister and I can be even
and everything can go back to normal.
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>You understand?
</p><timestamp>00:04:27</timestamp>
<p>Not really,
but I get to have sex with you?
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah.
-Correct.
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>Then, cool. I'm in.
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>-But what about your reputation?
-I'm not too worried about it.
</p><timestamp>00:04:35</timestamp>
<p>I feel like people
generally want to like me.
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>And if I just don't do anything,
eventually, the universe will realign
and the public will go back
to loving me again.
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
-Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>-Mm, thanks for making breakfast.
-Thanks for calling it breakfast.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>Not everyone appreciates
the subtle art of the crispy oatmeal.
</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>-Are you starting your memoir today?
-That was the plan.
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>But I got these dishes now.
That'll take all morning.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>And once the morning's over,
basically the whole day is shot, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>Better to start clean tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>Look, I know it's hard
to start a new thing,
but the hardest part is starting.
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>You're right.
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>Also, I'm a freelance cameraman
who pays child support,
so I'd encourage you to get an advance.
</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p>Hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>indistinct chattering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>Hey, uh, guys? Uh, excuse me, everyone?
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>I just wanted to raise
a non-alcoholic toast to Denise.
</p><timestamp>00:05:24</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
-Ha-ha!
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man</subtitle> Ow! My gluten intolerance!
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>We've all been through so much together,
and it's never easy to say goodbye.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>-Remember when Doug left?
-<subtitle>all</subtitle> Hmm?
</p><timestamp>00:05:34</timestamp>
<p>-Or Jameson?
-<subtitle>all muttering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>Or sweet, sweet Bongo?
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>-Sorry, who are we talking about?
-To Denise!
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all</subtitle> Denise!
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>I didn't realize
we're the last of our original group.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>-God, we had some good times, huh?
-I mean, no, mostly.
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah. But you're ready, right?
-Ready or not, here I go.
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, you're ready.
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>Have you given any thought
to what we discussed yesterday?
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>About you transitioning to a version
of yourself that is no longer here?
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>I don't know.
Things are kinda working for me.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>Staying out of trouble,
got the fancy room,
finally perfected
my egg-white omelet order.
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>The secret is egg yellows.
I might do another six weeks.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> You've already re-upped
three times.
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>This place is for people in crisis.
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>In crisis of being too cool, maybe.
Right, Karmen?
</p><timestamp>00:06:16</timestamp>
<p>-I-If I say yes, I can see my baby?
-Karmen, no.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>You sold your baby to a den of leeches
to pay for crack.
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p>-The leeches have your baby now.
-Oh, yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>Ah. Classic Karm.
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>It's natural to be hesitant.
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p>When I first checked out of rehab,
I was terrified.
</p><timestamp>00:06:33</timestamp>
<p>I knew a single drop of alcohol
would send me down a ruinous path.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>-But I found my way.
-Found your way back to rehab.
</p><timestamp>00:06:39</timestamp>
<p>-Ah, I'll miss our little comedy routines.
-"Our"?
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>
<p>A lot of people leave this place,
and I think, "They're not gonna make it."
Like Denise, for example.
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>But you?
You've done the work, and you're ready.
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>You're a special case, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>-I am?
-Of course you are.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Sharona</subtitle><i> Oh, boy,</i>
<i>did he do a number on you.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>He was actually very nice.
You know, I want things to be easy on set.
</p><timestamp>00:07:07</timestamp>
<p>And I think Danny
represents a fresh start.
</p><timestamp>00:07:09</timestamp>
<p>-Is that why you got Herb fired?
-Hey, I'm not the one who--
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>I can't do your hair
if you're gonna move your head so much.
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>There was nothing I could do about Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>If it wasn't for me,
they would've canceled the whole show.
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p>And then where would you go?
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>Who's gonna hire
a hair-and-makeup lady with shaky hands?
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>-My hands only shake when I don't drink.
-Be sure to put that on your r√©sum√©.
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>You're just bitter because I'm the only
person who can drink as much as you do.
</p><timestamp>00:07:36</timestamp>

crashed into the root beer factory!
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>Oh, sounds like a delicious disaster.
</p><timestamp>00:07:51</timestamp>
<p>-Five people are dead!
-Oh, no!
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>And there's worse to come,
unless somebody can slurp up
all that ice cream!
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I'd love to help slurp,
but I just started a new nannying job.
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>I don't care!
</p><timestamp>00:08:06</timestamp>
<p>Hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:08:11</timestamp>
<p>Wow, BoJack leaving rehab.
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>-Truly the end of an era.

<p>Last time I'm gonna stop
at this vending machine.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>What do you say, B-7?
One more hike down Funyun Canyon?

<p><subtitle>inhales</subtitle> Whew.
</p><timestamp>00:08:32</timestamp>
<p>Oh, wow. Hello, the public.
</p><timestamp>00:08:35</timestamp>
<p>Didn't think I'd have to address this
so quickly, but I am not ashamed.
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p>-Yes, I, BoJack Horseman, went to rehab--
-Uh, keep it moving.
</p><timestamp>00:08:41</timestamp>
<p>We wanna get a clean shot
for when Gen Z pop superstar/fashion
disrupter Joey Pogo shows up.
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>-Joey Pogo?
-Yeah, he's checking in today.
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>-We heard he's gettin' the fancy room.
-Fancy room?
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>He's gettin' the fancy room.
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>-It's time to go home.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>Ready or not.
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>I got the fancy room.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>He's gettin' the fancy room.
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>You're a special case, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>Stay cool, man. Have a good summer.
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>What does it all mean?
</p><timestamp>00:09:15</timestamp>
<p>Sounds like they're kicking you out
to make room for Joey Pogo.
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>Sounds like they're kicking you out
to make room for Joey Pogo.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>I think they're kicking me out
to make room for Joey Pogo.
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>I just feel like if I knew
the source of my addiction,
everything else would just click together.
</p><timestamp>00:09:34</timestamp>
<p>-Playtime's over.
-BoJack!
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p>-What the hell? This is my time.
-Shut up, Brad.
</p><timestamp>00:09:38</timestamp>
<p>The source of your addiction
is wanting to impress your old babysitter
who stole beer from your parents' fridge.
</p><timestamp>00:09:43</timestamp>
<p>She's dead. You're free.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>No, that's not...
</p><timestamp>00:09:45</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>I thought you were checking out.
</p><timestamp>00:09:48</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you?
-Yes. I've been very clear on that matter.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>Well, check this out.
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>BoHo go bye... BoHo go bye-bye for...
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>What is he doing?
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>I think he's trying to get out a zinger.
We better let him finish.
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>You have to imagine that I just said it.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>It's only funny
if it feels extemporaneous.
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>Don't waste your breath setting it up,
just say the thing.
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>-Why don't you start over?
-Check this out.
</p><timestamp>00:10:13</timestamp>
<p>BoHo go bye-bye for JoJo Pogo?
</p><timestamp>00:10:16</timestamp>
<p>That's a no-go, bro.
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>Worth it.

<p><subtitle>car horns blaring</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:22</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. Please, go around.
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>I worked on it all night.
The thing that's gonna save your career.
</p><timestamp>00:10:29</timestamp>
<p>Ha!
</p><timestamp>00:10:30</timestamp>
<p>-What is it?
-It's a meme! For posting online!
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Teacher gave you too much homework?
"Sad Dog!"
</p><timestamp>00:10:36</timestamp>
<p>Your favorite sports outfit
lost the match? "Sad Dog!"
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p>People are gonna love it.
And that love will transfer to you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:42</timestamp>
<p>But I'm not a sad dog.
I'm a happy dog. Everyone knows that.
</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>

-Pickles! How was your date with Carl?
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>I don't know, Mister.
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>The sex was good, like, really good,
but I didn't feel an emotional connection.
</p><timestamp>00:11:00</timestamp>
<p>Don't beat yourself up about that.
You just met the guy.
</p><timestamp>00:11:02</timestamp>
<p>But part of the betrayal
of you sleeping with Diane
is the fact that you share
an intimate history.
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>If we're really trying to even things out,
I don't think Carl counts.
</p><timestamp>00:11:12</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, then I guess you'll just have
to keep having sex with people
until you find someone with whom you have
an emotional connection.
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> That might be a lot of guys,
but if that's what it's gonna take

<p>Hey, it's Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yes, I thought I heard
retired dads in the distance,
praising the '95 Chicago Bulls.
</p><timestamp>00:11:39</timestamp>
<p>Maybe you could give me some advice.
I'm writing a new book,
but I shouldn't even get started
until I sell it to a publisher, right?
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>-What is it?
-I'm still in the loose idea phase.
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>Half essay, half memoir.
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>The working title is
</p><timestamp>00:11:50</timestamp>
<p><i>One Last Thing, and Then I Swear to God</i>

-Hello?
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>Hi, while you were blabbering on,
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>I had our lit assistant
take care of everything.
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>A navel-gazey book of observations.
Sounds fun.
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>-<i>No, I--</i>
-I sold it. You have six months.
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>Enjoy the process.
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>Oh.

<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>Wha...
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>What happened?
You're packing your things backwards.
</p><timestamp>00:12:27</timestamp>
<p>What happened is you said I was special.
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>You gave a whole spiel
 just trying to get rid of me
to make room
for a high-profile new client.
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>I thought we'd made strides
on your jealousy issues.
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p>And also, it's pronounced "shpeel."
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>I'm not jealous! And I've definitely
seen it written out as "spiel."
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>I think it's spelled "spiel,"
but it's pronounced "shpeel."
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>Not now, Joey Pogo.
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, am I interrupting?
I was told I was in the fancy room?
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>We're moving some things around.
Uh, maybe you could come back tomorrow?
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>Oh, tomorrow is jammed.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>I'm shootin' a video
for my new single, "Lace Up,"
which is spon-con
for my sneaker collab with Mister Pibb.
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>-Could we just do it now, real quick?
-You wanna do rehab real quick?
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>Life is precious. God is religious,
or merely the idea of human connection.
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p>Don't do drugs. Say you're sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:13:06</timestamp>
<p>Powerful stuff.
Feels like I just got a new lease on life.
</p><timestamp>00:13:09</timestamp>
<p>Stay cool, bro. Don't ever change.
</p><timestamp>00:13:11</timestamp>
<p>That's the problem. When you say it
in here, it all sounds easy.
</p><timestamp>00:13:14</timestamp>
<p>But I know that out there,
it's hard and confusing.
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>-And it's just-- I-I don't...
-But you're not alone.
</p><timestamp>00:13:19</timestamp>
<p>You have a wonderful support system.

<p>You're probably wondering about Georgette,

<p>-the newest member of Team Chavez.
-Nope.
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>Since I've started
taking care of Ruthie full-time,
that hasn't given me a lot of time
for regular Todd business,
and stuff's been falling
through the cracks.
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>So, you hired an assistant?
</p><timestamp>00:14:01</timestamp>
<p>Well, yes, but assistants
are like <i>Deadpool</i> movies.
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>I couldn't just stop at one,
even though I probably should have.
</p><timestamp>00:14:07</timestamp>
<p>Now I have 12.
</p><timestamp>00:14:10</timestamp>
<p>You hired 12 assistants? To assist <i>you?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p>Yep, I've got Bella
trying out new goofy dances,
</p><timestamp>00:14:16</timestamp>
<p>Pedro's monitoring
all the Five Guys franchises
to make sure each one
has the right number of guys,

<p>My asexual dating app.

-But another ace could join any day now.
</p><timestamp>00:14:35</timestamp>
<p>And when that happens, two of a kind.
</p><timestamp>00:14:37</timestamp>
<p>Well, I guess that makes about
as much sense as the rest of it.
</p><timestamp>00:14:40</timestamp>
<p>Listen, um, I might be getting out
of rehab soon...
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, that's fantastic!
</p><timestamp>00:14:45</timestamp>
<p>...and I wanted to talk to you
because I, uh...
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:51</timestamp>
<p>...can't do this by myself.
</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I got you, buddy.
You just wait one jiffy.
</p><timestamp>00:15:03</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:05</timestamp>
<p>-Hi.
-Ah!
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm Casey, the assistant.
Todd hired me to be your friend.
</p><timestamp>00:15:09</timestamp>
<p>Okay, that's, uh, you know...
I think I'm good. Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:15:11</timestamp>
<p>He said I would be perfect for you
because you could be mean to me
and you wouldn't feel bad,
because you're paying me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:16</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, that's kind of thoughtful.
</p><timestamp>00:15:19</timestamp>
<p>I'm a very good assistant, and I can be
very discreet, whatever you need.
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>
<p>Marc Cherry used to dress me
in the outfit Natalie Wood drowned in
and scream at me for hours on end.
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>It was very therapeutic for him,
and I didn't mind
because he wasn't screaming at me,
he was screaming at death.
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>Stars really are just like us, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:15:34</timestamp>
<p>-Do you mind if I have a sip?
-Don't drink that!
</p><timestamp>00:15:36</timestamp>
<p>Right, of course.
I must earn hydration. So sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:15:39</timestamp>
<p>No, it's just... that's vodka.
</p><timestamp>00:15:41</timestamp>
<p>You think it's a good idea
to keep a bottle of vodka in rehab?
</p><timestamp>00:15:45</timestamp>
<p>Because it is if you think it is.
</p><timestamp>00:15:47</timestamp>
<p>It's not for drinking.
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p>I just, I... I don't know why I keep it.
As a reminder, I guess.

<p>Hey, BoJack,

<p>Danny? Yeah, he's okay. Right?
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>-I miss Herb.

</p><timestamp>00:16:20</timestamp>
<p>Herb. Danny. What difference does it make?
We got a job to do, right?
</p><timestamp>00:16:23</timestamp>
<p>I'm just saying I miss him.
</p><timestamp>00:16:25</timestamp>
<p>And I'm just saying
it's not my fault he got fired.
</p><timestamp>00:16:27</timestamp>
<p>-I dunno why you're complaining to me.
-I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:16:29</timestamp>
<p>Nobody said it was your fault.
</p><timestamp>00:16:31</timestamp>
<p>I actually think
Danny represents an opportunity.
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p>For a new beginning.
</p><timestamp>00:16:34</timestamp>
<p>You don't think it feels weird
to do the show without Herb?
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>
<p>If Herb really cared about the show,
maybe he shouldn't have...

<p>What? Been gay?

<p>Do you know how lucky we are to have this?
Herb was gonna throw that all away.
</p><timestamp>00:16:49</timestamp>
<p>I made the tough choice. What did you do?
</p><timestamp>00:16:51</timestamp>
<p>-I... I don't know.
-BoJack, she's ten!

</p><timestamp>00:17:10</timestamp>
<p>Okay. You know why this is here, Casey?
</p><timestamp>00:17:13</timestamp>
<p>It's because I think I'm special
and the rules don't apply to me.
</p><timestamp>00:17:16</timestamp>
<p>And I keep thinking that
over and over again.
</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>I can't. Please don't make me.
</p><timestamp>00:20:34</timestamp>
<p>-You don't know what I'm like out there.
-Let's find out.
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>

Go to AA meetings. Go to a psychiatrist.

<p>Isn't it possible
 I'm one of those people

</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>No. You're not that special.
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>

<p>Yeah? It's going good?

<p>Yeah, you were right.
Once I got started, it was easy.

<p>So much of my career has been
writing for and about other people,

</p><timestamp>00:21:44</timestamp>
<p>It's actually really refreshing

</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>Well, I don't want to interrupt your flow.
Please, write on.

<p>Brad was like, "It's difficult to have

</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>Can you believe that?
He's extremely attractive, no?
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>-I don't...
-And honestly, is Brad a hot name?
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>-Brad Pitt, yes.
-Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>But like, name one other handsome Brad.
</p><timestamp>00:22:17</timestamp>
<p>-Bradley Cooper.
-Damn it!
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>Doctor Champ, I am so sorry.
That was vodka you drank, not water.
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>

<p>I forgot how fun this is.
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>-Just settle down, okay?
-Ah!
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>You're gonna spend the night here
and sober up.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>Oh, so it's easy to be sober
all of sudden.

<p>Settle? Manzanita?

<p>Listen, you're doing great.
Slight change of plans, though.
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>Sarah Lynn had to go home early.
So, we need to change the episode
to being about you
<i>not </i>bringing Sabrina to the office.
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>Is she okay?
</p><timestamp>00:23:23</timestamp>
<p>Uh, only reason I'm telling you this
is you're my main guy here,
and I know you want
what's best for everyone.
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p>-Of course.
-Sarah Lynn got her hands on some alcohol.
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God.
-Her mother is apoplectic.
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>She wants to sue.
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>I think it's just big talk,
but someone needs to be held accountable.
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>And as the guys in charge here,
we're responsible
for figuring out who that's gonna be.
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>-What are you...
-I need you to be straight with me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>-That wasn't your alcohol, right?
-Oh, I don't...
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>It wasn't, right?
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>Because if it was,
we're all in real trouble.
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p>-You get what I'm saying.
-Y-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>So, you don't know
where she got the alcohol from?
</p><timestamp>00:23:59</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I have no idea.
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>Okay. But someone's gotta answer for this.
</p><timestamp>00:24:04</timestamp>
<p>Well, don't look at me.
</p><timestamp>00:24:06</timestamp>
<p>Hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Nothing. Just a little uneven, is all.
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p>Oh. I'm screwed. I'm so screwed.
</p><timestamp>00:24:25</timestamp>
<p>-It's gonna be okay.
-No!
</p><timestamp>00:24:27</timestamp>
<p>I'm drunk. Not okay.
You can't let anyone know about this.
</p><timestamp>00:24:30</timestamp>
<p>-Shush!
-Yeah. Shh.
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>You gotta stay with me until I sober up.
I can't be alone here like this.
</p><timestamp>00:24:37</timestamp>
<p>It's okay, I'm here.
</p><timestamp>00:24:38</timestamp>
