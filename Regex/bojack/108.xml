</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, I'm off to Malibu
to see Herb Kazzaz.
</p><timestamp>00:00:18</timestamp>
<p>He has cancer, which,
as you know, is a whole thing.
</p><timestamp>00:00:20</timestamp>
<p>Plus, he hates me,
so I could really use
some good news
at the end of the day.
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God.
You're going to see Herb?
</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>You must be really--
Nope.
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>- Don't care. Not interested.
- <subtitle>phone beeps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>Okay, Good talk.
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>- Ready for this?
- Listen.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>I want to make sure
I don't spend
any time alone with Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>I'm bringing you
along as my buffer.
</p><timestamp>00:00:40</timestamp>
<p>And your memoirist.
</p><timestamp>00:00:42</timestamp>
<p>I should meet
your old best friend
before he dies of cancer.
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>Fine, I guess.
</p><timestamp>00:00:45</timestamp>
<p>Just don't abandon me.
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p>No bathroom breaks.
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p>And don't slip out
of the room
to text your fianc√©
a bunch of winky smileys
with hearts next to them--
Gross.
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>Congratulations on
the whole being engaged thing,
</p><timestamp>00:00:57</timestamp>
<p>- by the way.
- Thanks.
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>It's just starting
to hit me.
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>I'm getting married.
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>Thank God I don't
have to die alone.
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>- No offense.
- None taken.
</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p>Till you said, "No offense."
</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p>So what's the deal with you
and this guy?
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p>You never talk about him.
</p><timestamp>00:01:10</timestamp>
<p>Well, I kind of, maybe
stabbed him in the back.
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, it's a bit of a story.
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>A story of power, betrayal,
and ambitious hairstyles.
</p><timestamp>00:01:21</timestamp>
<p>The year?
198--
</p><timestamp>00:01:22</timestamp>
<p>- Movie's over.
- Watch the next one.
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p>Aw, I'm tired
of watching movies.
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>- Do you want to play a game?
- Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:01:30</timestamp>
<p>I spy with my little eye
someone who needs
to shut the hell up.
</p><timestamp>00:01:34</timestamp>
<p>- Is it me?
- It's always you.
</p><timestamp>00:01:36</timestamp>
<p>- Now, where was I?
- You were about to tell
a story about you being
a shitty friend,
but then, we got interrupted
by you yelling at Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:01:42</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah.
Shut up, Todd.

It's on the house.
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>Don't tell my boss.
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>Thanks, Charlotte,
but one beer gets me tipsy.
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>I got to be clear-headed
for my set.
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>Looks like Herb's killing.
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, and the suits
from ABC are here.
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>Look. They're nodding.
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>That's the executive version
of laughing.
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>Wow. They must be serious
about Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>That's Angela Diaz.
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>She's the woman who made
pantsuits a thing.
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh, before I forget.
</p><timestamp>00:03:34</timestamp>
<p>Herb and I are gonna see
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p><i>Back to the Future </i>again
this weekend.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>- Want to come?
- I'm in.
</p><timestamp>00:03:38</timestamp>
<p>That movie was amazing,
except for all
the lame time period jokes.
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>We get it.
The '50s were different.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>I'll have
a New Coke, please.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>Listen, you guys don't need
to include me on your dates.
</p><timestamp>00:03:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sometimes, it makes me feel
like a third wheel.
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, stop.
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>Without the third wheel,
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}how would you ride
a tricycle?
</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Wouldn't that make it

</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>Herb Kazzaz,
ladies and gentlemen.

</p><timestamp>00:03:58</timestamp>
<p>- Hey-ooh!
- Great set, man.
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>It's like everything
you said was something
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>I've thought before but never
had the balls to say.
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>Thanks, BJ.
I set 'em up.
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>Now, you knock 'em down.
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Let's give it up
for BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- <subtitle>applause</subtitle>
- Well, thank you, Bubbles.
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I love L.A.
Don't you guys?
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>The prettiest girls in
the world flock to this city,

with total knobs.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>Take this couple,

<p><subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me, miss.
Is that your date?
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>He's my husband.
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>That's your husband?
You can do better.
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>Give me a call
after the show.
</p><timestamp>00:04:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- <subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
- I'm just kidding around.
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>

I'm not kidding around.

</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Not judging.
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That guy tipped me a quarter.
</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's barely enough money
to buy three gallons of gas.
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- You want a slug?
- No, I got to stay sharp.
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I got another audition
this afternoon.
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}God, I can't wait till
I'm finally up
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}for real jobs instead
of these dumb commercials.
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"Here's the thing about
most long-distance plans."
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. I hate
when people say that.
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>- "Here's the thing."
- It's so stupid.
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>Just say the thing.
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>You don't need to introduce
the concept
that there's going
to be a thing.
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>I don't expect to
be offered <i>Secretariat</i>
right away,
but when am I gonna be up
for real roles?
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>We'll get there, BJ.
We both will.
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>In fact, if I play
my cards right,
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>I might get there real soon.
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>Wait.
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>- Did the guys from ABC call?
- Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>They invited me
to some hotshot event
at LACMA this weekend.
</p><timestamp>00:05:23</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna pitch 'em a TV show
while they're drunk.
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>An off-the-clock,
non-work-related social event?
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>That's the perfect time
to pitch a TV show.
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>You're brilliant.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>These people are so fancy.
</p><timestamp>00:05:34</timestamp>
<p>Look, look, look.
Hey, hey, look.
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>That's Joyce DeWitt,
isn't it?
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>That's Joyce DeWitt.
And that's Angela Diaz.
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>And that's Ubu,
the guy who sits.

<p>- He<i> </i>is<i> </i>a good dog.

</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>Guys, don't take
your eyes off the prize.
</p><timestamp>00:05:46</timestamp>
<p>We need to fill Charlotte's bag
with these mini quiches.
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>This is our breakfast
for June.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>- Herb Kazzaz.
- Shit, we're busted.

</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>Salutations.
Crap, that's English.
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you mind if I steal
this superstar for a second?
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>Okay, yeah.
I'll catch you two later.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>Stay out of trouble.
Oh, ho.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>Well, there he goes.
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>Herb's about to hit
the big time,
and I'm just gonna be
a small-fry
doing tiny commercials
and eating mini quiches.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>You're dead wrong.
</p><timestamp>00:06:10</timestamp>
<p>You're gonna be
a big success.
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>Herb says that to me
all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>- He thinks the world of you.
- He does?
</p><timestamp>00:06:16</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I'm not worried about
if you'll become a star.
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>I'm more worried about how
you'll change when it happens.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>Like, you think I'll get fat?
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>No, that's not
what I'm talking about.
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>So you're saying
I definitely
</p><timestamp>00:06:26</timestamp>
<p>- won't get fat?
- No.
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>Well, make up your mind,
lady.
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>Look over there.
See those tar pits?
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>Hollywood's a real pretty town
that's smack on top
of all that black tar.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>By the time you realize
you're sinking,
it's too late.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>Wait, is this
a science lesson?
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>No, BoJack,
it's a metaphor.
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>
<p>- Ugh, that's worse.
- BoJack, I'm moving to Maine.
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Really?
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>- Does Herb know?
- Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>I don't think I'm the person
Herb's looking for.
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>I'm going to miss you,
Charlotte.
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>Hey, do you ever wonder
what would have happened
if you'd met me
before Herb did?
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>Would you have made
a move on me?
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>- Charlotte--
- I don't think you would have.
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>You know why?
</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p>I think you're a coward.
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>Now go stuff some prosciutto
in your pants
before that Webster kid
takes it all.

<p>Why did you bring me
to Griffith Park?
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>Are we gonna get in
a knife fight
like in
<i>Rebel Without a Cause?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>- I hate that title.
- He had several causes.
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>I wanted to give you this.
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>Look out at that city.
</p><timestamp>00:07:24</timestamp>
<p>What do you see?
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>Wow, I didn't realize
there were
so many day hookers.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>I see a city
that you and I
will run someday,
and when we're both famous
and have everything
we've ever wanted,
we'll come back here together
and high five.
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>I'm not fully on board
with this new high five thing.
</p><timestamp>00:07:39</timestamp>
<p>What ever happened
to the low five?
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>Give me some skin.
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>BJ, listen.
I got a call from ABC today.
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>They bought my TV pitch.
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>What?
That's amazing.
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>- What's the show?
- It's called <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>Well, good luck
on your rocket ship
to the top without me.
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>No, BoJack,
the show's about a horse,
and I told those suits
if they want my show,
then that horse is gonna
be BJ Goddamn Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>- Oh, my God.
- And they said, "No."
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>- Oh.
- And I said, "Please?"
</p><timestamp>00:08:06</timestamp>
<p>And they said, "Okay."
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>So, what do you say?
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>- Want to be my star?
- Seriously?
</p><timestamp>00:08:11</timestamp>
<p>Of course I do.
Of course, Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>Jesus Christ, thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p>Mm-hmm--
Whoa, whoa.
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>I think you got
the wrong idea here.
</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>- Yeah, no, man. Whoa.
- Herb, I'm not--
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>Me either.
No, I just-- You know,
</p><timestamp>00:08:22</timestamp>
<p>- I caught up in the moment.
- Yeah, no, I gotcha.
</p><timestamp>00:08:25</timestamp>
<p>BJ, can you believe it?
</p><timestamp>00:08:26</timestamp>
<p>We're gonna make
an actual TV show!

<p>One that takes
an unflinching look
at the gritty reality
of the American family.

</p><timestamp>00:08:52</timestamp>
<p>Why would I say,
"You'll never get me
in that sweater"
in this scene
and then,
in the very next scene,
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>I'm wearing the sweater?
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p>Did my character suddenly forget
that he didn't want to wear
the sweater?
</p><timestamp>00:09:03</timestamp>
<p>No, see,
that's actually the joke.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>Don't explain the joke to me.
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>I just don't understand
how it's a joke.
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>So you do want me
to explain it to you?
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>I want you to add
a scene showing
how I changed my
mind about the sweater
so the goddamn episode
makes sense.
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p>Look at me,
doing your job for you.
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>Way to go, Shakespeare.
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>BJ, you're doing
the scene as written.
</p><timestamp>00:09:19</timestamp>
<p>What happened
to the stories I requested?
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>Where's my rap?
You said you'd write me a rap.
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>We're working on it.
</p><timestamp>00:09:26</timestamp>
<p>We just need a rhyme for
"and I'm here to say."
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>Well, what about giving me
Rollerblades?
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>How are people gonna know
that my character is hip
if he doesn't roll the blade?
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>Just get out there
and do your job.
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p>Every one of your ideas
is stupid or racist.
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>That was one pitch,
and I didn't say
they're all thieves.
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>But if you're too scared
to start
a national dialogue,
maybe I'll take my ideas home.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>Good luck making <i>Horsin' Around</i>
without the horse.
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, hon.

<p>I know we haven't been close

what I'm talking about.
</p><timestamp>00:13:14</timestamp>
<p>That's great.
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>We just gotta make sure
that we work in the phrase

<p>"toothbrush rap" early,
so they know I'm rapping.
</p><timestamp>00:13:22</timestamp>
<p>BoJack,
can we chat for a second?
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. Here we go.
It's the big one.
</p><timestamp>00:13:29</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna waste
your time with small talk
because you work for me,
and your time is my time.
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>We're letting Herb go.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>- You can't do that.
- "I can't do that."
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>I'm not asking you.
It's nothing personal.
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>I like Herb.
I think he's a good guy.
</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>
<p>But this is a business,
and every day
we don't fire him,
we're flushing money
</p><timestamp>00:13:44</timestamp>
<p>- down the crapper.
- Well, if he goes, I go.
</p><timestamp>00:13:46</timestamp>
<p>"Well, if he goes, you go."
I wouldn't do that.
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I think you're a star,
and sometimes being a star
means making tough choices.
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p>You can storm out,
make a big show out of
what a "good" friend
you are,
or you could be
the guy who does his job.
</p><timestamp>00:13:58</timestamp>
<p>- Angela--
- I'll tell you when
it's your turn
to talk again.
</p><timestamp>00:14:01</timestamp>
<p>Look, you're a star,
but this is really just
the beginning of
the BoJack Horseman story.
</p><timestamp>00:14:05</timestamp>
<p>You can choose
whatever path you want,
but I'll tell you right now.
</p><timestamp>00:14:09</timestamp>
<p>You don't win awards
and you don't
get to be on the covers
of magazines
and you don't get
to play the lead role
in the <i>Secretariat </i>movie
by being a good friend.
</p><timestamp>00:14:18</timestamp>
<p>What's that old expression
about how the show must go on?
</p><timestamp>00:14:20</timestamp>
<p>Oh, right.
It's "Don't be an idiot."
</p><timestamp>00:14:23</timestamp>
<p>So what do you think, BoJack?
That's a courtesy question.
</p><timestamp>00:14:26</timestamp>
<p>I already know what you think
because I have conversations
like this one five times a day.
</p><timestamp>00:14:31</timestamp>
<p>I know who you are,
and I know
you've already
made your decision.
</p><timestamp>00:14:34</timestamp>
<p>But if you want
to surprise me,
now's the time to do it.
</p><timestamp>00:14:37</timestamp>
<p>That's what I thought.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>You're doing the right thing.
I know it's hard.
</p><timestamp>00:14:41</timestamp>
<p>But if Herb's really your
friend, he'll understand.
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>Now, you've got
a show to put on,
so I'll let you get ready.
</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>This was a good conversation.
Productive.
</p><timestamp>00:14:49</timestamp>
<p>If you're lucky,
I'll never talk to you again.

<p>What is so great
about liquids?

<p>Every article I read now is
"juice this" and "juice that."

</p><timestamp>00:18:16</timestamp>
<p>I'm sensing a lot

</p><timestamp>00:18:18</timestamp>
<p>Maybe we should take
our masks off and actually talk.
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p>You want me to take
my mask off? Fine.
</p><timestamp>00:18:25</timestamp>

I took my mask off.
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>

<p>Did you think that
I spent the last 20 years
on my couch just feeling
sorry for myself?
</p><timestamp>00:18:41</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I did do that,
but I also started...
</p><timestamp>00:18:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>coughs</subtitle> a charity
to bring clean water

in Sub-Saharan Africa.
</p><timestamp>00:18:48</timestamp>
<p>Oh, wow.
</p><timestamp>00:18:49</timestamp>

the Teen Choice Awards.
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>Wait, is that Charlotte?
</p><timestamp>00:18:53</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah.
We kept in touch.
</p><timestamp>00:18:54</timestamp>
<p>You should actually
give her a call.
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure she'd
love to hear from you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:57</timestamp>
<p>She looks good

</p><timestamp>00:19:35</timestamp>
<p>Kenzie, do you have

</p><timestamp>00:20:09</timestamp>
<p>I should have brought
a bottle of wine.
</p><timestamp>00:20:11</timestamp>
<p>That's what adults do.
BoJack, damn it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:13</timestamp>
<p>Is that what's bothering you,
</p><timestamp>00:20:15</timestamp>
<p>- that you didn't bring wine?
- You're right.
</p><timestamp>00:20:17</timestamp>
<p>I just would have drunk it
on the way here.
</p><timestamp>00:20:19</timestamp>
<p>This isn't about wine,
BoJack.

you should do it

it'll be too late.

what happened.

<p>Yes. I'm sorry.

<p>Okay.
I don't forgive you.

<p>Yeah,

<p>No. I'm not gonna

</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>You don't get that.

<p>You have to know that
it's never,

we'd both

</p><timestamp>00:21:27</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna feel better,
and I'm not gonna be your prop
so you can feel better.
</p><timestamp>00:21:31</timestamp>
<p>You have to believe me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>- I did everything I could.
- Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>Then why didn't you call me?
Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>

it was like for me?

<p>I had nobody.
Everybody left.
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>I knew all those showbiz phonies
would turn on me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>Sure. But you?
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>It's not my fault
you got fired.
</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p>I don't care about the job!
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>I did fine.
I had a good life.
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>But what I needed then
was a friend,
and you abandoned me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>

for that.

<p>Well, I know you better
than anyone,

that you're not.
