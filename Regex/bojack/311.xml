<p>Good morning, morning.

<p>Good morning, sun.
Good morning, trees.
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>Good morning, busy buzzy bees.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>Good morning, Sarah Lynn.
Good to see you, Sarah Lynn.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>The tulips and chrysanthemums
are really coming in.
</p><timestamp>00:00:31</timestamp>
<p>Good morning, handsome garden ants.
</p><timestamp>00:00:33</timestamp>
<p>I like the way you plant my plants.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>Your flowers make my feelings dance.
I like your handsome planter pants.
</p><timestamp>00:00:42</timestamp>
<p>Goddamn it!
Why won't you--? <subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p>It's okay.
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>Sarah Lynn, you are calm,
you are thin.
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>Your skin is so soft, it's like you
murdered a baby and stole its skin.
</p><timestamp>00:00:54</timestamp>
<p>Your skin is "murdered-baby" soft.
</p><timestamp>00:00:57</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>Blueberry, goji berry, flax,
chia, shark fin, and... white rhino horn.
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p>Sober, so good.
</p><timestamp>00:01:15</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>phone vibrating</subtitle>
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:01:17</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack?
-Hey, Sarah Lynn.
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p>-You wanna party?
-Oh, thank God. Yes!
</p><timestamp>00:01:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Okay, hand me the a√ßai.
</p><timestamp>00:02:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Is that how you pronounce it?
-Who knows?
</p><timestamp>00:02:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}They should really just call them
"overpriced blueberries for douchebags."
</p><timestamp>00:02:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Ow.
-How's life?
</p><timestamp>00:02:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Well, the truth is that...
-Didn't catch that, but everything's cool?
</p><timestamp>00:02:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No. In fact, I've never felt so alone--
</p><timestamp>00:02:36</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, missed it!
You should learn to talk louder, dude!
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>Oh, hey, bummer about you
getting the nomination,
but then, it turning out
that you didn't get the nomination.
</p><timestamp>00:02:43</timestamp>
<p>It was big news yesterday.
</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yeah, I got royally screwed,
know who was there for me?
</p><timestamp>00:02:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No one, because everyone's an asshole
and the whole world sucks balls.
</p><timestamp>00:02:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Anyway, thanks for having me over.
-I'm with you, man.
</p><timestamp>00:02:53</timestamp>
<p>Everything sucks! Especially sobriety.
Why would I make my body a temple?
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>I've been to Temple.
Temple is super boring.
</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>What do you say
we go on an epic bender?
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>Yes! Let's get higher
than a stilt walker's dick!
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's what I'm talking about.
Let's get some booze and drugs.
</p><timestamp>00:03:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We can clear out my bank account.
I got nothing left I care about.
</p><timestamp>00:03:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What do you mean "get"?
This whole house is booze and drugs.
</p><timestamp>00:03:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Here.
-Yogurt-covered raisins?
</p><timestamp>00:03:16</timestamp>
<p>-Nope. Vicodin-covered Vicodin.
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>-LSD.
-Wow.
</p><timestamp>00:03:21</timestamp>
<p>-Yah! Crystal meth.
-Ha-ha!
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>Ee-yah!
<subtitle>snorting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>Cocaine-- No! That's drywall.
</p><timestamp>00:03:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ugh! Where the hell
did I hide the cocaine?
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, yeah, I also told
the liquor store to deliver.
</p><timestamp>00:03:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
To nine months of sobriety.
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p>To life and being done with it!
</p><timestamp>00:03:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>both laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Okay, okay. What about this one?
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>Remember when Erika Eleniak
guest starred as Goober's cousin
from out of town,
and Brad had a boner
for the whole episode?
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>-What? No.
-You can totally see it in every scene.
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Cold open, boner! Act one, boner!
</p><timestamp>00:03:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Commercial break-- "Hello, we're from
the Wheaties corporation!" Back to boners!
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>Okay, we'll put it on the list.
We gotta watch that one.
</p><timestamp>00:04:03</timestamp>
<p>What about the one where the writers
made Joelle dress up like a pumpkin,
and the whole episode was fat jokes,
so then Joelle got an eating disorder?
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>Everything was so much simpler back then.
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}She had to go to a clinic.
She missed, like, five episodes.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We didn't know how good we had it.
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We got to come to work
and have fun every day,
and we weren't worried
about our legacy or awards.
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>...because buildings are supposed
to be rectangles, goddamn it!
</p><timestamp>00:04:27</timestamp>
<p>Wait, what were we talking about?
</p><timestamp>00:04:28</timestamp>
<p>We were talking about <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>Then, you had to go pee.
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>Then, you came back
covered in toilet paper
and pretended to be a mummy.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>Then, you took it all off
because you decided Egypt was stupid,
especially pyramids,
because you think triangle buildings are,
and I quote, "gauche as shit."
</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>That does sound like me,
but I don't remember any of that.
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>I must have blacked out.
Maybe I should lay off the alcohol for--
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>...and I said, "You're sitting
on the pizza, Mr. President."
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa! I think I just had another one.
-Another what? Pizza?
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>No, blackout. The thing
we were just talking about.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>-Try to keep up here.
-Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>Boom! Boner! Pay up!
What did I tell you?
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>That's not a boner. It's a shadow.
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p><i>Well, I think we all learned</i>
<i>a valuable lesson today</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p><i>about the Armenian genocide.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p><i>The Armenian genocide</i>
<i>was too much, man!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>audience laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>All right! Next episode.
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>Why can't life be like it was
on <i>Horsin' Around?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>All our issues conveniently settled
in 22 hilarious minutes.
</p><timestamp>00:05:24</timestamp>
<p>You know, it's amazing
that it's legal for kids to be actors.
</p><timestamp>00:05:27</timestamp>
<p>How is that not child labor?
I didn't know what I was signing up for.
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>-I was three.
-This is getting me depressed.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>-Let's do something fun.
-Oh! Okay, you know what really kicks ass?
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>The planetarium!
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>You get crazy high in the parking lot,
then you go in and get your mind blown
by all the trippy galaxies and shit.
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>That sounds stupid.
I'm gonna be in charge of the fun.
</p><timestamp>00:05:46</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>snorting</subtitle>
No, no, no! That was drywall.
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>Jesus, we have to start
marking our drugs more clearly.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>-Let's just take a box of whiskey and go.
-Whoo!
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>male voice</subtitle> It was just so hard.
-Wha--? What the--?
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>I was stuck in a terrifying cycle
of drinking, lifting my head up,
drinking, lifting my head up,
drinking, lifting my head up.
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>Coffee, stale donuts, attention hogs
telling boring stories about themselves?
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>-Jesus! Are we at a 12-step meeting?
-Now, you're a detective?
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>Last night, you couldn't even solve
the mystery of where the toilet is.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>So, all our partying was
an elaborate trick
just to get me to go sober?
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>No, Detective Pukes
in the Washing Machine.
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p>You're here because I couldn't
leave you alone in my house,
and I had to come today.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>Gotta get my nine-month chip.
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>Chip? We've been wasted for...
31 hours?
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>That's no reason for me
to not get my chip.
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>That's literally exactly the reason
you shouldn't get your chip.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>Nowhere in the 12 steps
does it say to not drink.
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>That's not actually one of the steps.
Loophole.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>Take a swig.
</p><timestamp>00:06:39</timestamp>
<p>If you have to listen to losers talk
about their shitty sober lives,
it's a lot more fun to be buzzed.
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>And I realized people don't change
because they want to change.
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>They change because they have to change.
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God. Boo!
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>Oh, booing is generally
frowned upon here.
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>How else am I supposed to express
how boring these stories are?
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>speaking slowly</subtitle>
My name is Simon and I'm an alcoholic.
</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all</subtitle>
Hi, Simon.
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>My rock bottom was
when I actually woke up under a rock.
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>Can't get lower than that.
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>Come on!
You people call yourself drunks?
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>Most of this is stuff I do
on a daily basis completely sober.
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>Trust me, pal,
we've done some awful things.
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>One time, I didn't want
my friend to move out,
so I used character actress Ann Dowd
to help me sabotage his hip-hopera.
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>Oh, please, that's baby stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>You so-called drunks want
something to feel shitty about?
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack, maybe we should go.
-I got somethin' for ya. Whoa.
</p><timestamp>00:07:34</timestamp>
<p>My name is BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all</subtitle>
Hi, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, like you didn't know?
</p><timestamp>00:07:39</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, I once went all the way down
to New Mexico to see a woman that I knew,
and she had a young daughter, Penny.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>Penny Carson. That's her real name.
You can look her up. I don't care.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>And first, I tried to sleep
with the mom, but she said no.
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>-Then, I tried to sleep with the daughter.
-<subtitle>all groaning</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>Then, the mom walked in on me
trying to sleep with the daughter,
and I was like,
"Oopsie-doopsie! Exit stage right!"
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God.
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>The worst part is, I don't even know
what happened after I left.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>Did I ruin the family?
Did I scar that little girl for life?
</p><timestamp>00:08:05</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. I'll never know.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>And that's just, like,
one of a billion things
that I have going through my head
all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>So, anyone got a better story than that?
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>Wow.
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p>Didn't think so, bitches.
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>Where's my trophy, or chip,
or whatever?
</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>screams</subtitle>
-<subtitle>car horn honking</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa!
-<subtitle>screams</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>tires squealing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>That was impressive, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:08:25</timestamp>
<p>I've never seen them cancel an AA meeting
because everyone got bummed out before.
</p><timestamp>00:08:29</timestamp>
<p>Uh, what are you talking about?
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>You told everyone about that Penny chick.
</p><timestamp>00:08:32</timestamp>
<p>Then, you went on and on
about how you're never going to change.
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>Then, you chased the slug around,
threatening to pour salt on his head.
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p>-I talked about Penny?
-Hey! We've all done shitty stuff before.
</p><timestamp>00:08:41</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>tires squealing</subtitle>
-<subtitle>loud crash</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>Most of us aren't as proud of it
as you seem to be.
</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>
<p>I'm not proud. I feel really terrible that
I might have really messed that girl up.
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>Oh, she's fine.
I looked her up on Facebook.
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>She's going to Oberlin,
likes Thai food and the smell of a fire
on the first really cold day of winter.
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>That doesn't mean anything.
Everyone likes the smell of fire
on the first cold day of winter.
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p>You know, I used to feel just like you
before I got into this "12 steps" thing.
</p><timestamp>00:09:03</timestamp>
<p>They taught me how to make amends.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>You just say you're sorry
for the things you did
and you get a clean slate.
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>-So, what? Just dirty up the slate again.
-Then, you just make amends again.
</p><timestamp>00:09:11</timestamp>
<p>It's a never-ending cycle,
where you always end up
feeling good about yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:09:15</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>man</subtitle> No!
-You know what?
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>This may be the nitrous
and bath salts talking,
but I want to do some more
nitrous and bath salts.
</p><timestamp>00:09:21</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>tires squealing</subtitle>
-<subtitle>crash</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>And then, let's make
some goddamn amends.
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>Maybe you should start with the family
whose playhouse you just smashed.
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>crying</subtitle> Oh, no!
-Oh. Hey, kid!
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry your lame dad built
such a cheap-ass playhouse!
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, you gotta use parallel joints
to support that foundation, dumbshit!
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>-Also, suck a dick!
-You know what? I do feel better.
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
-<subtitle>crying</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>doorbell ringing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>-I don't think they're home.
-So, we wait.
</p><timestamp>00:09:48</timestamp>
<p>I need to make amends to Diane,
and we're not leaving until I do.
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> But it's boring out here,
and I'm hungry and I'm bored!
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>I bet they have food inside.
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>Let's see if I still have
that spare key. Here it is.
</p><timestamp>00:09:59</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
-Yes!
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>Okay, after we get food,
remind me that this is another thing
I need to make amends for.
</p><timestamp>00:10:05</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs, burps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:07</timestamp>
<p>Where are those two?
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>They did not keep their fridge
stocked enough
for two stoned people
waiting around for hours.
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>It's only been, like, ten minutes.
You have a real thing with food.
</p><timestamp>00:10:15</timestamp>
<p>That's what happens when you mix
the appetite of a horse
with the appetite of someone
with a hole inside him
that needs to be constantly filled
with attention, food, and sex.
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>-Pass the Bugles.
-There's no more Bugles.
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>There's no more of anything.
Let's just go.
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>
<p>-I can't leave until I make amends.
-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle> I got a idea!
</p><timestamp>00:10:31</timestamp>
<p>My name is BoJack's friend What's-Her-Face
and I wear glasses.
</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>Do you have something
to say to me, BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>-Am I BoJack or Mr. Peanutbutter?
-You can be anyone you want.
</p><timestamp>00:10:40</timestamp>
<p>This is your dream... dream... dream...
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>Stop doing that. We're both awake.
Let's just get to this.
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>Diane, I'm sorry
I said mean things to you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>That's cool. I forgive you.
Wait, would my character say that?
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>What's Diane's deal again?
She's, like, an Asian Daria?
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>-She's a little more complex.
-But she's basically Asian Daria, right?
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>With the glasses and the jacket
and her whole "blah" thing.
</p><timestamp>00:11:03</timestamp>
<p>Okay, shut up.
Now, I'll be Mr. Peanutbutter
and you make amends to me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>Who's Mr. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>And, now, you be Mr. Carolyn
and I'll be Princess Diana.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, yeah. Good idea.

</p><timestamp>00:11:13</timestamp>
<p>Um... should we do something about this?

sleep this off in our guest room?
</p><timestamp>00:11:20</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, that mirror is talking to us!
</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>
<p>You can't stop us, us from the future!

<p>Ow! Come on!
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>-That felt so good!
-See?
</p><timestamp>00:11:33</timestamp>
<p>When you make amends,
don't you just feel lighter?
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>Well, I also ate
a shit ton of Bugles, so no.
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>But I do feel like we got to the bottom
of who really killed Princess Di.
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>-It was all of us.
-Next stop, Todd!
</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p>Todd, I'm sorry. I want to take
full responsibility for what happened,
even though it is not my fault
and I did nothing wrong.
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>Emily is an adult woman
who can make her own choices.
</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p>And besides,
are you even really into girls?
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>-I mean, what is your deal?
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, what are you doing with our son?
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>Wait, you're BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:12:01</timestamp>
<p>I am, and this is
my best buddy Todd. <subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:04</timestamp>
<p>That movie star has really
taken a shine to our boy.
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>You think this is our big break?
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>You don't think he's inappropriately
interested, do you?
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>What? No. But if he is,
that could also be a big break.
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>I'm just saying.

<p>-Come back.
-You want to take Todd for a sleepover?
</p><timestamp>00:12:21</timestamp>
<p>-Sleepover?
-No offense, Todd,
but your parents are creeping me out.
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>

-I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm very drunk and a little nauseous,
but if I'm here in your house,
it must be to make amends.
</p><timestamp>00:12:38</timestamp>
<p>-Amends... for what?
-I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>Whatever it is that you think I did
to make you disappear.

<p>-BoJack--
-How could you leave me like that
when I needed you most?
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, BoJack. I thought
you were a winner. I was wrong.
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>This is hard for me, too.
I staked my reputation--
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>No, this is not about the Oscar campaign.
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>How could you think
that this is about the Oscar campaign?
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>We had something more, didn't we?
</p><timestamp>00:12:56</timestamp>
<p>-You've been drinking.
-Well, not just drinking.
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>snorting</subtitle>
Yes, Ana, I'm a mess.
</p><timestamp>00:13:02</timestamp>
<p>Whoa! I am a broken,
screwed-up misfit toy,
and you act all in control,
but I know that, deep down,
you're broken, too.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>And I don't know why you won't just
give us a chance to be broken together.
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>What about that doesn't appeal to you?
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:19</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, when I was in college,
I had a job as a lifeguard...
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>Wait, did we just go to Ana's house?
Did I get closure?
</p><timestamp>00:13:27</timestamp>
<p>If by "closure" you mean
I lit her ottoman on fire, then yes.
</p><timestamp>00:13:30</timestamp>
<p>We gotta go back.
</p><timestamp>00:13:32</timestamp>
<p>-What the hell?
-I know I was just here,
but I feel like you told me
some important story
that explained everything about us.
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>Unfortunately, I totally spaced it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:40</timestamp>
<p>Gotta be honest.
I've had a couple beers.
</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>Ugh! All right, I'll tell you again,
if it'll make you leave.
</p><timestamp>00:13:46</timestamp>
<p>When I was a lifeguard, I...
</p><timestamp>00:13:48</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, crud.
-You want to go back to Ana's, don't you?
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>I feel like I'll definitely
get it this time.
</p><timestamp>00:13:53</timestamp>
<p>Lifeguard...
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>-One more time?
-No. This time I wrote it down.
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>"I'm a lifeguard. This woman's house
smells weird, or is that me?
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>Pay attention, Sarah Lynn.
</p><timestamp>00:14:04</timestamp>
<p>Don't do that thing
where you write down your thoughts
instead of what the person
is actually saying.
</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>
<p>I wonder if it's time to get
my boobs done again."
</p><timestamp>00:14:11</timestamp>
<p>-Mm-hmm.
-<subtitle>inhales</subtitle> That's very helpful.
</p><timestamp>00:14:13</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so I know
I keep bothering you tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:14:32</timestamp>
<p>Tonight? I haven't seen you
in two weeks.
</p><timestamp>00:14:35</timestamp>
<p>Oh, really?
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>I just need to know what you were
trying to tell me about being a lifeguard,
and then, I'll leave
and you'll never see me again.
</p><timestamp>00:14:41</timestamp>
<p>Mmm...
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>After I almost drowned, I decided
I would never again be weaker than water.
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>So, I became a lifeguard.
</p><timestamp>00:14:49</timestamp>
<p>On my first day of training,
my instructor told me
that there are going to be times
when you'll see someone in trouble.
</p><timestamp>00:14:56</timestamp>
<p>You're going to want to rush in there
and do whatever you can to save them,
but you have to stop yourself,
because there are some people
you can't save.
</p><timestamp>00:15:05</timestamp>
<p>'Cause those people
will thrash and struggle
and try to take you down with them.
</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>
<p>What does that have to do with me?
</p><timestamp>00:15:16</timestamp>
<p>What the--?
Where the hell are we now?
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p>-Ohi--
-Ojai?
</p><timestamp>00:15:20</timestamp>
<p>-We drove all the way to Ojai?
-Let me finish.
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>
<p>Ohi, and here's the kicker... O.
</p><timestamp>00:15:25</timestamp>
<p>-Ohio.
-We drove all the way to Ohio?!
</p><timestamp>00:15:28</timestamp>
<p>I wanted to go to the planetarium,
but you demanded we come here.
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>You said you had to make
one more amend, to that Penny girl.
</p><timestamp>00:15:36</timestamp>
<p>What? No! That is a terrible idea.
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>
<p>-Let's turn this car around right now.
-<subtitle>tires squealing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:39</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:15:41</timestamp>
<p>-I feel we didn't turn the car around.
-No, we did,
but then, you turned it back around
because you really wanted
to find that deer girl,
so we decided to do a stakeout.
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>There was a whole makeover sequence,
where we went to the mall
and tried on different trench coats
for each other.
</p><timestamp>00:15:54</timestamp>
<p>Do you not remember any of that?
</p><timestamp>00:15:56</timestamp>
<p>This is insane.
I already scarred her for life.
</p><timestamp>00:15:59</timestamp>
<p>If I see her again, I'll just end up
getting my horribleness all over her.
</p><timestamp>00:16:02</timestamp>
<p>You think it's too late for me
to go to college?
</p><timestamp>00:16:04</timestamp>
<p>I always wanted to be an architect.
</p><timestamp>00:16:06</timestamp>
<p>But one of those architects,
where, at night,
she's a high-end call girl,
and, by day,
she's an international superspy.
</p><timestamp>00:16:12</timestamp>
<p>-So, when is she an architect?
-I don't know. Frontier times?
</p><timestamp>00:16:15</timestamp>
<p>No, I didn't mean what era.
</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>
<p>If she's a call girl at night
and a spy during the day--
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, look, Penny.
-Oh, God, what's she doing?
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>-Does she look emotionally damaged?
-She's just going to the computer.
</p><timestamp>00:16:24</timestamp>
<p>She's probably in a sex chat room
with some middle-aged horse
because that's the only way
she can still feel love.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, probably.
-Or she's so upset about what you did
that she's using the Internet
to find ways to commit suicide.
</p><timestamp>00:16:36</timestamp>
<p>That makes even more sense.
</p><timestamp>00:16:37</timestamp>
<p>All right, we've established
that you ruined her.
</p><timestamp>00:16:40</timestamp>
<p>-Can we go back to L.A. now?
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>
<p>So... obviously, I wanted to keep
following Penny because I'm an idiot.
</p><timestamp>00:16:47</timestamp>
<p>Let's just nip this in the bud.
</p><timestamp>00:16:48</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna write "Do not follow Penny"
on my hands
in the unlikely scenario
of my blacking out again.
</p><timestamp>00:16:53</timestamp>
<p>I'll just write "Follow Penny"
on this hand,
and then, on this hand, I'll write...
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p>-Goddamn it!
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:17:00</timestamp>
<p>We're just doing what the hand said.
</p><timestamp>00:17:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:04</timestamp>
<p>-Uh, what?
-The hand demanded donuts.
</p><timestamp>00:17:07</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle> There she is.
-She's drinking beer.
</p><timestamp>00:17:09</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God, this is just like
the episode of <i>Horsin' Around</i>
when Olivia went to the frat party,
but Penny doesn't have a kind angel
played by Jose Canseco
to help her get out of this jam!
</p><timestamp>00:17:17</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. Okay, now, I'm bored again.
Quit hoggin' the 'nocs.
</p><timestamp>00:17:20</timestamp>
<p>She's just drinking Red Bull.
Wait. Now, she's leaving.

</p><timestamp>00:17:31</timestamp>

<p>Too fine, like she's hiding a dark secret
that's eating away at her soul.
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>Or, possibly... she's fine.
</p><timestamp>00:17:40</timestamp>
<p>Maybe I didn't ruin her life.
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you were a father figure,
who was sexually inappropriate to me,
and I turned out perfect.
</p><timestamp>00:17:46</timestamp>
<p>-Now, can we please go home?
-Okay, good plan.
</p><timestamp>00:17:48</timestamp>
<p>I'll just go pee out the last 20 beers.

<p>-What are you doing here?
-Hey, Penny!
</p><timestamp>00:18:02</timestamp>
<p>-Did you come here to find me?
-No, I--

<p>You can't be here.
I-I don't want to see you here.
</p><timestamp>00:18:08</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to see you at all.

</p><timestamp>00:18:30</timestamp>
<p>You know, on the plus side,
she really seemed okay.
</p><timestamp>00:18:33</timestamp>
<p>Mm-hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>-Until she saw you and freaked out.
-<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:36</timestamp>
<p>But she probably would have been
totally fine if you'd never shown up.
</p><timestamp>00:18:40</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, God.
-I think the wound was completely healed
before you reopened it by showing up
unannounced at her college
and all the pain came
rushing back to her.
</p><timestamp>00:18:48</timestamp>
<p>Oh, good Lord!
</p><timestamp>00:18:49</timestamp>
<p>In a way, it's like
you destroyed her life twice.
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>

<p>Well, I'll be a dick sucked by a dumbshit!
What do we have here?
</p><timestamp>00:19:12</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that? Turns out there's
a brand of heroin called BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:19:15</timestamp>
<p>Dude, that's a big freaking deal.
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>
<p>Getting a drug named after you
is cooler than getting an Oscar.
</p><timestamp>00:19:20</timestamp>
<p>I mean, there's Billy Crystal Meth,
Angel Dustin Hoffman,
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p>Lucille Eightball and now you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:25</timestamp>
<p>It's a rarefied breed, man.
Congratulations!
</p><timestamp>00:19:28</timestamp>
<p>-Thank you?
-Oh, we have to do BoJack!
</p><timestamp>00:19:30</timestamp>
<p>-It's too perfect.
-I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:19:32</timestamp>
<p>There's that old saying.
"Liquor before beer, never fear.
</p><timestamp>00:19:34</timestamp>
<p>Don't do heroin."
</p><timestamp>00:19:35</timestamp>
<p>"I'm BoJack.
Please, put me inside you."

<p>I'm not gonna shoot heroin
with you, Sarah Lynn.

Happy Thanksgiving 2007.
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>Why did you just say what year it is?
</p><timestamp>00:19:58</timestamp>
<p>I guess I just get nervous
talking to network executives.
</p><timestamp>00:20:01</timestamp>
<p>This last episode got
the worst ratings yet.
</p><timestamp>00:20:04</timestamp>
<p>I was afraid your character trying heroin
would be a bridge too far.
</p><timestamp>00:20:08</timestamp>
<p>-Oh.
-And the disjointed blackout structure,
with the one flashback in the middle,
really confused our audience.
</p><timestamp>00:20:14</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:20:14</timestamp>
<p>They hated all
the fourth-wall-breaking meta jokes.
</p><timestamp>00:20:17</timestamp>
<p>Of course. Audiences hate meta jokes.
When will comedy writers learn?
</p><timestamp>00:20:21</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I know there is an audience
out there for our show.
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>We just need to find a way
to get more people to check us out.

Full frontal.
</p><timestamp>00:20:29</timestamp>
<p>I was thinking guest star.
</p><timestamp>00:20:31</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:20:34</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, what about Sarah Lynn?
-Ooh, that's genius!
</p><timestamp>00:20:37</timestamp>
<p>Sarah Lynn? I don't know.
I haven't spoken to her in years.
</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>Besides, she's not gonna
want to do this.
</p><timestamp>00:20:42</timestamp>
<p>She's the world's biggest pop star.
</p><timestamp>00:20:44</timestamp>
<p>She's the only hope we have
to keep this show alive.
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>Would you ask her?
I'm sure she'd do it for you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>You're like a father to her.

<p>-So, what is it?
-What is what?
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>You were mumbling about
how you had to ask me something.
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>Oh! Um, never mind. Hey, how long
have we known each other?
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>-Feels like our entire lives.
-Well, my entire life, pretty much.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>We were on a TV show.
Isn't that insane?
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, it's pretty wild.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>You know, sometimes it feels like you're
the only one who really understands me,
because how could anyone else?
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>Nobody knows what we went through,
nobody who wasn't on that show.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>But we knew each other
before we were anybody,
and that's how we can be friends,
because we're not like those other people.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>The people who glom onto you
because of who they think you are,
and they think they can sleep
on your couch and eat your food.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>They think you're gonna
save their agency.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>I never asked for that kind of pressure,
but you and me, we don't want
anything from each other.
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>You know, I... I could never
figure out what love meant,
but, right now, I don't need
to figure out anything.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>I just feel it.
I love you, Sarah Lynn.

<p>BoJack... I don't...
like anything about me.

<p>-This house isn't me.

</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>The only reason I wear this shirt
is because some company
paid me $8,000 to wear it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>And I don't even need the money.

<p><subtitle>scoffs</subtitle> I just liked that someone
still wanted me to wear their shirt.

Everything's gonna be okay.

<p>What am I supposed to do?
I don't know what to do.
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>Am I doomed? Are you doomed?
Are we all doomed?
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>No, no! Calm down. Nobody is doomed.
