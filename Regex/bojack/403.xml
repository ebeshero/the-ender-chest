<p>I heard before he played triangle
he was in a prison gang.
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>I heard he was a tech millionaire.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>in French accent</subtitle> There is a rumor
he is a foreign prince.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>-His name is Todd Chavez.
-<subtitle>gasping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:42</timestamp>
<p>And he's the most giving man
the world has ever known.
</p><timestamp>00:00:45</timestamp>
<p>He saved my pregnant daughter
from drowning in a shipwreck,
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p><i>then he delivered her baby</i>
<i>while they rode on a piece of driftwood.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>musicians gasp</subtitle>
<i>-And then he circumcised her baby</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p><i>while they both hung from the ladder</i>
<i>of the rescue helicopter.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
<i>-Of course, before he did,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p><i>Todd Chavez explained that circumcision</i>
<i>has somewhat fallen out of vogue.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p><i>They had a spirited</i>
<i>but respectful debate,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p><i>and by the end my daughter decided</i>
<i>that since we are of Jewish heritage,</i>
the boy might like to have the option
to become religious if he so chooses.
</p><timestamp>00:01:15</timestamp>
<p>Sounds like he really helped your daughter
make the decision
that was right for her family.
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p>And last year, when our triangle player
died of starvation
after getting his foot stuck
in his triangle,
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>Todd Chavez took over
because we needed him.
</p><timestamp>00:01:27</timestamp>
<p>-What a guy!
-He is always helping others.
</p><timestamp>00:01:29</timestamp>
<p>You know, sometimes
when that triangle part is coming up,
</p><timestamp>00:01:33</timestamp>
<p>I find myself hoping he won't show up.
</p><timestamp>00:01:35</timestamp>
<p>No man should be asked
to give that much.
</p><timestamp>00:01:38</timestamp>
<p>-He is truly the best of all of--
-Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:01:41</timestamp>
<p>Oh, hey, guys. I was eating a taco earlier
and I got salsa on my shirt.
</p><timestamp>00:01:45</timestamp>
<p>I went to clean it off, but then when
I put my hands in the automatic dryer
</p><timestamp>00:01:48</timestamp>
<p>I forgot I was still holding the taco.
</p><timestamp>00:01:50</timestamp>
<p>I got my hands all greasy,
so I couldn't open the doorknob
for an hour.
</p><timestamp>00:01:54</timestamp>
<p>What you guys talking about?

</p><timestamp>00:02:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Katrina</subtitle> So then at 11:00 you're gonna be
giving a policy speech on fracking.
</p><timestamp>00:02:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Fracktastic!
</p><timestamp>00:03:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Meanwhile, all this talk
of whatever it is you're talking about
</p><timestamp>00:03:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-is making me hungry.
-Mmm?
</p><timestamp>00:03:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Cheese? Yes, please!
</p><timestamp>00:03:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Todd, don't distract Mr. Peanutbutter
with your weird pocket cheeses.
</p><timestamp>00:03:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The issue is fracking and the people
really want to know your opinion.
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>Well, then, color me "the people"
because I would also like
to know my opinion.
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You don't have one yet.
The polling research comes in today
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and that will decide whether
you're for or against fracking.
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Here's a thought:
maybe be against fracking.
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-It's terrible!
-Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>Just my opinion.
You don't tell me how to do my job.
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Also, fracking is the worst. I can't 
believe you'd even consider endorsing it.
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}None of my business.
Gotta get to work. Love you!
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Bye, hon!
-But seriously, seriously,
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}if you come out in support of fracking
I'm gonna be super upset. Bye!
</p><timestamp>00:03:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Where you stand on the issue
doesn't really matter.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>What's important is that
you seem sincere and emphatic.
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>Ohh. Are you a fan of charming
but inessential Will Smith movies?
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>Because, slight <i>Hitch,</i>
I always show I'm empathic
by taking off my glasses dramatically,
but I kinda lost them.
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Wow! This must be what I'd look like
to a starving shipwrecked person.
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> When did you last see the glasses?
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>I was in a meeting with Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:04:03</timestamp>
<p>She was saying
I'm always forgetting stuff,
so I whipped off my glasses,
looked her square in the eye and said,
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>"I never forget a thing."
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>I might have left my glasses there.
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Todd, you never do anything.
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Why don't you take the campaign bus
over to VIM
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and get Mr. Peanutbutter's glasses?
Can you handle that?
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I never know if I can handle anything.
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>That's what makes my life so exciting.
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-<subtitle>both grunting</subtitle>
-Mr. Peanutbutter, there's a delivery!
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>Katrina</subtitle> He's busy! Just sign for it.
</p><timestamp>00:04:28</timestamp>
<p>I can't sign for another man's mail.
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>That's how I ended up with the cremains
of Cornelius Vanderbilt.
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>It all started when a young Todd--
<subtitle>grunts</subtitle> I don't have time for this!
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>I've got a job to do.
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>panting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Princess Carolyn</subtitle> It's Todd!
-It's me!
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>You are just the guy I need.
You know the actress Courtney Portnoy?
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>I think so. She portrayed the formerly 
portly consort in <i>The Seaport Resort</i>?
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>Courtly roles like
the formerly portly consort
are Courtney Portnoy's forte,
but she's got a new action movie
that's supposed to change her image:
<i>Ms. Taken.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>You know Mr. Taken
from the <i>Taken </i>movies?
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>-This is his niece.
-Nice!
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>This was supposed to be Courtney's 
crossover coronation.
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>But that's sort of been thwarted, 
unfortunately,
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>'cause Courtney's
purportedly falling short
of shoring up four-quadrant support.
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>Makes perfect sense so far.
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>The public sees her as out of touch.
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>We need to make her seem relatable,
and the best way to do that
is to be seen dating a down-to-earth
boring nobody like yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>You can do that, right?
You're not doing anything.
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>I'm kind of busy today.
I gotta pick up these glasses,
and then tonight there was this meeting
I wanted to go to.
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>This will take no time, I promise.
Meet her for lunch.
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>The paparazzi will show up,
pop some razzis.
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p>I do love getting my picture taken.
It's proof I exist.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>Marvelous!
Judah, prepare the press release.

</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>Well, we didn't get the polling research
on fracking--
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>-Here you go.
-Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>Because apparently when the delivery came
someone wouldn't sign for it.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>Ooh.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>In the future, whenever anyone asks you
to sign Mr. Peanutbutter's name,
</p><timestamp>00:06:07</timestamp>
<p>-just sign it.
-You got it, chief.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>All right, Middle-Aged Yeller,
here's what you're gonna do.
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>You're gonna give
an impassioned speech on fracking
that doesn't actually take a stand
either way on fracking.
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>Good morning!
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>Let's talk fracking.
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p>Everyone has very strong opinions
about it,
and I want you all to know,
right here and right now,
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>I am taking a stand.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>-I am on... your side!
-<subtitle>applause</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:36</timestamp>
<p>-What side is that, specifically?
-Good question.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>I am specifically
on the side of the facts,
and also on the side of feelings.
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>cheers and applause</subtitle>
-Well, I'm satisfied.
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>Oh, excuse me,
would Mr. Peanutbutter
be willing to sign this letter
to our state government?
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p>Yes. I'll write his name on anything.
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh, thank you so much.
</p><timestamp>00:06:57</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasps</subtitle> And down goes Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>And up comes Todd!
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>Aah! <subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa!
-Stay back!
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>Calm down, I'm not going to hurt you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>My name is Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim
Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.
-Wait, wait, wait.
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>-What's your first name?
-Hollyhock.
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>And your last name?
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson- 
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.
</p><timestamp>00:07:21</timestamp>
<p>Got it.
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>-Wait, what's your last name?
-I know, it's confusing.
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>-I have eight dads.
-How'd that happen? Test tubes?
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>-No. I was adopted.
-Oh, of course.
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>By eight men in a committed gay
polyamorous relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:07:34</timestamp>
<p>-Less of course.
-But ever since I was a baby,
people always said I looked like
BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:07:40</timestamp>
<p>-That's a terrible thing to say to a baby!
-<subtitle>skimmer clatters</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>And I've always wondered if BoJack
could be my biological... sperm guy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>I guess it's possible.
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>BoJack used to say his penis
is like sun-dried tomatoes:
back in the '90s it got into everything.
</p><timestamp>00:07:57</timestamp>
<p>I came to L.A.
to get to the bottom of things.
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>I even bought a deluxe spy kit.
Sorry about knocking you out.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>Once you have chloroform,
you can't <i>not</i> use it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:05</timestamp>
<p>No, I get it. BoJack had one
of those spy kits, too.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>He mostly just used the chloroform
on himself, though.
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>I read in his book that you live together.
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>-Can you help me find him?
-Sorry. I don't live there anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>And no one knows where he's been
for the last year.
</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>I guess I don't have to meet him.
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>All I need is a DNA sample,
like a piece of hair or something.
</p><timestamp>00:08:24</timestamp>
<p>-I guess his house might have-- <subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa!
-Sorry again. It's just so fun.
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>Okay, there might be some hairs
in the shower drain,
but hard to know who they belong to.
</p><timestamp>00:08:35</timestamp>
<p>Everyone who has sex with BoJack
usually takes a <i>long </i>shower afterwards.
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, I think I see a hair.
-<subtitle>moaning</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>-Yoink!
-What the... was...
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>exhales</subtitle> Okay.
-Okay, let's blow.
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>Blow? Who's got blow?
Save some for BoJack. <subtitle>groans</subtitle> Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:08:53</timestamp>
<p>Wait, Todd? Oh, shit. Are you gonna
yell at me? Can I have the blow first?
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>No. BoJack, there's no blow, okay?
And I'm not going to yell at you.
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>And what is this?
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim- 
Guerrero-Robinson-
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuacks?
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>That was a joke. Obviously, I've never
heard of your family and/or law firm.
</p><timestamp>00:09:15</timestamp>
<p>That was also a joke. Todd, who is
this tough crowd you brought to my home?
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>-Um, BoJack, this is your daught...
-Mm-mmm, mm-mmm!
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>...dot-dot maid.
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>Way to build up the suspense.
</p><timestamp>00:09:26</timestamp>
<p>To, uh, tidy up the place
in case you came back.
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>You got me a maid? Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>Here I thought Channing Tatum
was a good neighbor
for picking up my mail while I was gone,
but you, and after all the things
I did to you,
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>-I don't know how to tell you--
-BoJack, we haven't talked in like a year,
and that's actually been
kind of working for me.
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p>So, maybe it's better if we just
keep things like that, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>-Oh. Okay. So then why did you hire me--
-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:49</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah, deliver me.
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>You're welcome.
Now go get that DNA tested.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>panting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>Can you tell me if this is a match?
</p><timestamp>00:09:59</timestamp>
<p>-A match with who?
-Hollyhock.
</p><timestamp>00:10:02</timestamp>
<p>Manheim-Mannheim-Gorilla-Rub-a-Dub-Dub
Zoolander-Hallelujah-something-McDonald's?
</p><timestamp>00:10:07</timestamp>
<p>Whatever those words are,
I need a sample from her, too.
</p><timestamp>00:10:10</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle> Duh!
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>Bring it in an hour.
I gotta get to lunch.
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>Nothing like working
with hair, blood, and semen all day
to work up an appetite,
and it's already 1:00.
</p><timestamp>00:10:18</timestamp>
<p>1:00?
I gotta go meet my fake girlfriend!
</p><timestamp>00:10:21</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you have a fake girlfriend too?
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>Mine is a bunch of water balloons
with a blonde wig.
</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>
<p>I suppose a fancy restaurant like this
is too fancy for a common man
such as yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:10:33</timestamp>
<p>No, it's fine.
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>You'd probably like to take me
someplace rough and primitive.
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>Uh... do you want me to take you
somewhere else?
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p>Well, if you must drag me on some
barbaric adventure, I can't stop you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>There's a Pony Roma's
at Universal CityWalk.
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>A chain restaurant?
Oh, God, no, I'll be mugged.
</p><timestamp>00:10:48</timestamp>
<p>I can't do this.
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>Todd, I can never be
your dirty peasant girl, I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:11:20</timestamp>
<p>But I am learning so much
about my possibly-maybe birth father.
</p><timestamp>00:11:24</timestamp>
<p>Like, did you know he has a shoebox
in his closet full of bad reviews
for other people's TV shows?
</p><timestamp>00:11:28</timestamp>
<p>So all you've done so far
is snoop around?
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>I also ate a box of donuts,
got sleepy and took a nap.
</p><timestamp>00:11:36</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I'm not sure we really need
to do this DNA test.
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>Look, I didn't come all this way
to not find out
who my biological father is.
</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p>Okay, fine, then I just need you
to yank out a strand of hair
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>-so I can take it down to the lab.
-No way! That sounds painful.
</p><timestamp>00:11:50</timestamp>
<p>-Can't we just use your hair?
-Um...
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-<subtitle>panting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p>No, but I can pull out some of my hair
at the same time,
</p><timestamp>00:11:57</timestamp>
<p>-so you don't have to do it alone.
-Okay, that sounds fair.
</p><timestamp>00:12:00</timestamp>

was messier than when she started.
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p>I don't mind someone else
in the house with me,
in case I start choking on pills
or have a funny take on current events
that demands an audience, but if she
can't do her job, I gotta fire her.
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>You can't do that!
Here, buzz up real nice,
take a nap, and while you're sleeping,
I'll get the maid to clean

<p>That's actually a really good idea.

</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>Todd's phone. What do you want?
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>So, I see lots of pictures of you
at the fashion show,
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>-but none of you with Courtney.
-Oh, crap!
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunting, panting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:27</timestamp>
<p>-Hi.
-Oh, hello.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>Uh, why are you wearing my clothes?
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>These aren't anything like your clothes.
This hat alone cost $50,000.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>Oh. So, uh...
what's it like being a movie star?
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>It's awfully trying.
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p>Do you ever feel like
everyone's looking at you
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>-but nobody sees you?
-Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>No, I was speaking rhetorically
about a feeling that only movie stars get.
</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p>Ohh.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-But it feels good to talk about it.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Talking's good.
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>You know, there was a meeting
I was supposed to go to tonight,
but I don't think I'm gonna go.
I don't know if I'm ready.
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>Ready for what?
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>What if it's not everything
I want it to be?
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>Sometimes the idea of something
is better than the truth, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>I always prefer fiction to truth, 
personally.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>I've staked my career on it.
<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, that makes sense.
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>-Ha hah!
-Smile for the birdie.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Courtney, you canoodling
with a supermodel now?
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>-That's right.
-Fancy.
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>I love how not down-to-earth
you are together.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>This is going to really make headlines
when you two break up.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>Here's an even bigger headline:
we shan't be breaking up.
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>-We're engaged!
-Wowee!
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>Hooray! I'm confused!
</p><timestamp>00:22:38</timestamp>
<p>Hollyhock? Are you here?
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>No, but BoJack, who lives here, is here.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I gotta tell you, um...
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>
<p>-Hollyhock is your daughter.
-What do you mean?
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>-She's your daughter.
-I don't understand.
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p>She has Horseman DNA.
You're her father.
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>That's impossible. I'm BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
<p>She didn't want me to tell you,
but I thought you should know.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>I guess I don't blame her.
I wouldn't want to be my daughter either.
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>BoJack...
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>Look what I do to people
I'm supposed to care about.
</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p>I had sex with the one person
I've ever seen you be in love with.
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>I guess they're not gonna put you
in the best friends hall of fame,
but I don't know that I loved her.
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p>I don't think I'm allowed to be in love.
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>Don't say that.
You do so much for everybody.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>All you ever asked for
was a roof over your head
and the occasional s'more in a baguette.
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>I'm telling you,
it's a million-dollar idea.
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>I got more of you than I ever deserved.
</p><timestamp>00:23:26</timestamp>
<p>If you never talk to me again
I just want you to know
that I appreciate it,
and I appreciate you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>-Thanks.

</p><timestamp>00:23:33</timestamp>
<p>It was shitty
what you did with Emily, but, um...
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p>I think I'm... asexual.
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>A sexual what? Dynamo, deviant?
</p><timestamp>00:23:44</timestamp>
<p>Harassment lawsuit waiting to happen?
</p><timestamp>00:23:46</timestamp>
<p>No. Asexual, not sexual.
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>Ohh.
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>-I'm sure you think that's weird.
-Are you kidding? That's amazing.
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p>Sometimes I wish I was asexual.
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>Maybe then I wouldn't have
<i>a </i>strain of herpes.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>-You have multiple strains--
-I know.
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>The joke only works with the "a".
</p><timestamp>00:24:01</timestamp>
<p>It actually feels nice
to finally say it out loud.
</p><timestamp>00:24:05</timestamp>
<p>I am an asexual person.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>-I am asexual.
-That's great.
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p>So if you're not mad about Emily--
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>It wasn't just Emily, BoJack,
and I don't know if I'm ready for us
to be friends again yet.
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>
<p>-Oh. Okay.
-But we can be more than not-friends.
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>You know, for an asexual,
more than not-friends is probably
as good as it gets, right?
</p><timestamp>00:24:26</timestamp>
<p>I'm not really at a place yet
where I want to joke about it.
</p><timestamp>00:24:29</timestamp>
<p>-Got it, got it, totally.
-But it feels good to talk about it.
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>Well, if you ever need a place to crash,
that couch--
</p><timestamp>00:24:34</timestamp>
<p>-I'm gonna go.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:24:36</timestamp>
<p>-Right now?
-Welcome back, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:24:38</timestamp>
<p>It's good to see you.
</p><timestamp>00:24:42</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:24:44</timestamp>
<p>Hmm.
