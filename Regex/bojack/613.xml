<p>Hey, Hollyhock.
</p><timestamp>00:00:13</timestamp>
<p>Um, you still haven't returned
my last call, which is fine.
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>I just... I know you're going back
to school soon,
and you should know I won't be there.
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>Because of... everything
you've probably heard about.
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>So, if you were worried
you'd have to see me, you won't.
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>But I would love to talk.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>-It's BoJack.

</p><timestamp>00:02:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, just don't like Beau.
</p><timestamp>00:02:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Greetings, strangers!
-Maude?
</p><timestamp>00:02:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's what they want you to think!
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm Maude's twin sister Fergus,
we have never met before,
and I'd be delighted to accept a job
at this company.
</p><timestamp>00:02:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-<subtitle>scoffs</subtitle> What?
-As you know, I have 12 children.
</p><timestamp>00:02:47</timestamp>
<p>What sort of day care services
do you provide here?
</p><timestamp>00:02:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Has this ever happened to you?
</p><timestamp>00:02:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Todd? At the office?
</p><timestamp>00:02:53</timestamp>
<p>Can we wrap whatever this is up?
</p><timestamp>00:02:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm supposed to head over
to the "Birthday Dad" set.
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I wanna run a day care at VIM!
</p><timestamp>00:02:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I've mastered the art of looking
at one baby and I'm ready for more.
</p><timestamp>00:03:03</timestamp>
<p>You do have several employees
with children.
</p><timestamp>00:03:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}If you employ Todd through the company,
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}you could offer him a raise
and still save money on taxes.
</p><timestamp>00:03:09</timestamp>
<p>Great. It's done.
</p><timestamp>00:03:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hooray! Corporate tax loophole!
</p><timestamp>00:03:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Plus, we can carpool to the office.
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Which leads me to my next point.
I am moving out to live with Maude.
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It's me! It's Maude.
I don't really have a twin sister.
</p><timestamp>00:03:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hey, that's fantastic!
Where are you moving to?
</p><timestamp>00:03:24</timestamp>
<p>Um...
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>-You can stay here! Live with me forever!

</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The line is,
"Thank you for the birthday pizza.
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Today, I am your dad."
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, sorry!
-Let's take five?
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Hey, champ. Everything okay?
-I'm just distracted.
</p><timestamp>00:03:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ever since Pickles left, I've been
so lonely in that big, empty house.
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>I've always had a wife or a girlfriend,
someone to take care of.
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn,
you're perpetually alone.
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-How do you manage?
-One day at a time, buddy.
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>I went to the doctor to see
if he could make me feel better,
he said, "You should check out
this Internet meme,
it always cheers me up: Sad Dog."
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>And I said, "But Doctor, I am Sad Dog."
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>Guys, I'm really sorry
this keeps happening.
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>When I got home, I found my wife
and daughter had moved out.
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>All they left behind was this picture.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>-Okay. Rude.
-Shh!
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>It's the stock photo
that came in the frame.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>My wife kept asking me to put in a picture
of our family, but I was always too drunk.
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>But because of all of you
and my sponsor Leo,
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>I'm no longer just the man
who's not in this picture.
</p><timestamp>00:04:27</timestamp>
<p>I'm a different, better man
who is also not in this picture.
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>Who's next?
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>-Um, okay, I'll speak.
-Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>Things have been pretty brutal
for me lately.
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>-Most people hate me...
-Mm-hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>...I just lost five million dollars,
so that's not great.
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>Could probably use a Leo
of my own right about now.
</p><timestamp>00:04:50</timestamp>
<p>Wow, tough room.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>This AA meeting is a tough room.
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I'll be your sponsor.
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh! Um...
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>I know what you're thinking,
"Vance Waggoner?
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>That guy's gonna be my sponsor?
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>The guy Charlie Sheen
once called 'a little much'?"
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-"Vance Waggoner?
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>That guy's got more domestic assault
convictions than Sean Penn!"
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>And now you're thinking,
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>"Did Sean Penn get convicted
of domestic assault
or was it just alleged?
I gotta look that up later."
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>-I'm sure--
-Now you're thinking,
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>"Why would someone this cool
and put-together wanna sponsor me,
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>-dumb slob BoJack Horseman?"
-That's not--
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>Wait. I've been where you've been, BoJack.
And everyone abandoned me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>If you need someone to talk to,
give me a call, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>My number is 555-555-8008.
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>Because sometimes
life turns you upside-down,
and when you're upside-down,
my number is boobs.

</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>Diane! How are the revisions going?
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>Good! Usually at this stage
I hate everything I've ever written
and I feel like a worthless hack,
but this book actually isn't terrible.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>Great, so when can we expect
the not-terrible sequel,

<p>"Ivy Tran Two: A Tran for All Seasons"?
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>I don't know, Ivy Tran was fun
but I'm a grown-up writer.

<p><i>There are other things I wanna write.</i>
<i>Did you know Eleanor Roosevelt--</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>-Interesting.
-I didn't even tell you the thing.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>I know.
I was interested in you not telling me.
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>Okay, good bit.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>In the meantime,
if you're interested in writing books
that people actually read,
you'll get to work on "Ivy Tran Two:
Last Tran to Clarksville."

<p>BoJack, it's your very good

-Your very good lawyer Chaz!
</p><timestamp>00:07:11</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>The good news is the Sarah Lynn settlement
isn't gonna kill us.
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>What's the bad news?
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>The bad news is you're being sued
for a hundred million dollars.
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Remember in your interview,
when you disparagingly referred
to yourself as "a Xerox of a Xerox"?
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>The Xerox Corporation did not appreciate
being implicated
in your untoward behavior.
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>Just so I'm clear, Sarah Lynn's death
cost me five million dollars,
but saying something bad about a brand
is gonna cost me a hundred million?
</p><timestamp>00:07:36</timestamp>
<p>When you frame it that way,
it almost seems comical!
</p><timestamp>00:07:38</timestamp>
<p>But it is not comical,
because a hundred million dollars
is a lot of money you do not have.
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so what's the move?
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>

<p>Oh. She's resting at the moment.

I don't have anything to prove to her,
but I got a new job and an apartment,
so if I did have something
to prove to her,
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>-I'd have proven it by now.
-Well, that's wonderful, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:09:26</timestamp>
<p>Yes. And quite mature.
And she won't even talk to me.

<p>Is it a secret admirer
or the snowman killer still at large?
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>It's from Hollyhock. But... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:48</timestamp>
<p>I can't open it. What if she says
she never wants to hear from me again?
</p><timestamp>00:10:51</timestamp>
<p>Or maybe it says "I got rid of my TV
three months ago. What's new, BoJack?"
</p><timestamp>00:10:56</timestamp>
<p>I should just call her.
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>If I could talk to her,
I feel like I could explain that--

-Hey, Hollyhock. It's me again.
</p><timestamp>00:11:05</timestamp>
<p>And his good friend and roommate
and coworker, Mr. Peanutbutter!
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>It's our first day of work together!
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>I got your letter
and I haven't read it yet,
but I'm going to and...
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>It's really great to hear your voice...
your voicemail voice.
</p><timestamp>00:11:17</timestamp>
<p>-Just give me a call. It's BoJack.
-<subtitle>beeps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>-Ready to go?
-What about this breakfast?
</p><timestamp>00:11:21</timestamp>
<p>We don't have time for that!
You can feed me while I drive, let's go!

</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Judah. I need your advice.
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>I'm trying to throw
a sophisticated adult party
to impress my parents
and I have no furniture
or sophisticated adult friends.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>I'm alarmed. Do you not consider me
a sophisticated adult or a friend?
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>Judah, this is no time for one
of your famous Judah tantrums!
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p> Sounds like you need to throw together
a scheme in a short amount of time.
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>In situations like this, I often think,
</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p>-"What would Todd do?"
-And?
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>He'd probably scour VIM's talent list
for underemployed actors,
tell them they've been hired
for a site-specific immersive
theater piece as cosmopolitan partygoers,
invite just enough real friends
to lend it an air of legitimacy
and raid the "Birthday Dad" set
for furniture.
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>That's brilliant!
Todd, I've done it again!
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>-Let's go, babies!

</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>No. Not for me.
</p><timestamp>00:12:27</timestamp>
<p>Maybe I'm just a crazy,
old birthday person,
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>-but I think war is bad.

</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>Great job, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You're changing hearts and minds.
</p><timestamp>00:12:35</timestamp>
<p>Isn't this great? Working together?
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>For the next take,
can we get Dead Body Number Four
to face away from the camera?
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p>-Oh! That's you!
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>

-Cool dressing room.
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p>And great work on that scene.
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>You really seemed like
a hollowed-out corpse.
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>Once animated by the fire of life,
now consumed by horror
and regret, and for what?
</p><timestamp>00:13:07</timestamp>
<p>Great. You wanna get dinner?
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I'd love to, buddy,
but I have like five more scenes to shoot.
</p><timestamp>00:13:11</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Of course, yeah.
I'll see you back at the house then?
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Oh! I'm probably going to head
right to Todd's fancy party after work.
</p><timestamp>00:13:19</timestamp>
<p>Todd's having a fancy party?
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter,
we're ready for the scene
where you help an American soldier
and a Taliban insurgent
realize they both have the same birthday.
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>-It's Christmas.
-Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:13:36</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>line ringing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:38</timestamp>
<p>BoJack!
</p><timestamp>00:13:40</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Greetings, cast!
</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>
<p>As you know,
you have been hired to play urbane,
civilized party guests.
</p><timestamp>00:13:46</timestamp>
<p>So, if at any point tonight
a "member of the audience"
tries to talk to you,
please say one
of the three following phrases
that elegant adults say all the time:
</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>"I'm starting to think smart phones
are actually making us less connected."
</p><timestamp>00:14:01</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, yeah!
-"Well, that's politics for you!"
</p><timestamp>00:14:05</timestamp>
<p>Or, "Sir, you cannot remove your shoes
inside this Applebee's."
</p><timestamp>00:14:10</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all</subtitle> Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p>-Hey!
-Hello.
</p><timestamp>00:14:14</timestamp>
<p>What's that?
</p><timestamp>00:14:15</timestamp>
<p>It's a case of Ass-Jolt,
Pickles' favorite alcoholic energy drink.
</p><timestamp>00:14:18</timestamp>
<p>I don't need them anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:14:22</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, fish, I forgot a gift.
-You have two options.
</p><timestamp>00:14:24</timestamp>
<p>This sourdough starter
or a haiku I wrote on a grain of rice
</p><timestamp>00:14:27</timestamp>
<p>-and then suspended in a bottle.
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:14:29</timestamp>
<p>Why don't we just say
they're both from both of us?
</p><timestamp>00:14:31</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:14:34</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>woman gasps</subtitle> Ugh.
-And you don't wanna open it?
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>I'm not ready. As long as I don't read it,
she's still in my life.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>It's good to have people that remind us
why we stay sober.
</p><timestamp>00:14:42</timestamp>
<p>That's what my daughter is for me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>Here's your sandwich.
Chef made it just for you.
</p><timestamp>00:14:48</timestamp>
<p>Hmph, hmph, hmph.
</p><timestamp>00:14:52</timestamp>
<p>Okay, do I have a horn?
</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>Because everybody keeps looking at me
like I'm some kind of freak.
</p><timestamp>00:14:57</timestamp>
<p>Well, if you've got a horn,
you're the ugliest unicorn I ever saw.
</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>You'd be kicked out of the unicorn kingdom
because you couldn't get a date
to the marshmallow cotillion.
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, or because I snorted up
all the magic fairy glitter.
</p><timestamp>00:15:09</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>deep voice</subtitle> "This summer:
Dumbass Unicorn."
</p><timestamp>00:15:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> That's so stupid.
No, that's exactly what they'd do.
</p><timestamp>00:15:14</timestamp>
<p>It would be like
"Nasty Unicorn: The Unicorn Who Parties."
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>normal voice</subtitle> Yeah, and his horn
is like a corkscrew,
and he tries to open a bottle of wine,
but it gets stuck,
so now he's got this wine bottle
on his head,
just dripping wine down his face,
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>-like... <subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
-<subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>"Nasty Unicorn.
</p><timestamp>00:15:30</timestamp>
<p>He puts the 'U' in 'Eff you.'"
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>Okay, but it wouldn't be "Nasty Unicorn."
It would be "Horny Unicorn"!
</p><timestamp>00:15:36</timestamp>
<p>Oh, shit, that's amazing.
Now we have to do it.
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> What do you mean "do it"?
</p><timestamp>00:15:40</timestamp>
<p>The movie. You're the Horny Unicorn.
I'll direct. We're doing it.
</p><timestamp>00:15:43</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I'm not really the guy
people wanna see in movies right now.
</p><timestamp>00:15:46</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, they don't wanna see you
be <i>Secretariat</i> or raising orphans.
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>But they will see you be a rude dude
who says all the things polite society
is too limp-dicked to say.
</p><timestamp>00:15:55</timestamp>
<p>This is your way back in.
This is how you get that love back.
</p><timestamp>00:15:58</timestamp>
<p>"The Horny Unicorn"?
</p><timestamp>00:15:59</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, 'cause deep down, he's wounded.
He's misunderstood.
</p><timestamp>00:16:03</timestamp>
<p>It's not his fault he's the way he is!
</p><timestamp>00:16:05</timestamp>
<p>-And people are gonna see that!
-Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>Yeah! He's like, "Hey, buddy!
I never asked to be the horny unicorn!
</p><timestamp>00:16:11</timestamp>
<p>What? You think I like it that
I gotta jizz rainbows every 20 minutes
to keep my horn from going soft?"
</p><timestamp>00:16:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>
<p>Come on. I know you need the money.
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>When are you gonna stop
punishing yourself?
</p><timestamp>00:16:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>video game noises</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:26</timestamp>
<p>Flip it. No, you gotta... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
Flip the thing. Flip it.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Sonny, do you know
where the advance copy of my book is?
</p><timestamp>00:16:32</timestamp>
<p>Your stupid book about the mall?
</p><timestamp>00:16:34</timestamp>
<p>Haven't seen it.
'Cause I would never even notice it.
</p><timestamp>00:16:36</timestamp>
<p>-'Cause it's for losers. Girl losers.
-<subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:40</timestamp>
<p>You can just say losers.
</p><timestamp>00:16:41</timestamp>
<p>Girls can be losers without specifying
that they're girls.
</p><timestamp>00:16:44</timestamp>
<p>Will you let me know if you see it?
I need to get revisions to my publisher.
</p><timestamp>00:16:47</timestamp>

<p>-Hello.
-We're here for the party?
</p><timestamp>00:17:01</timestamp>
<p>We brought a plant.
</p><timestamp>00:17:02</timestamp>
<p>Uh, just one sec.
</p><timestamp>00:17:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm starting to think smart phones
are actually making us less connected.
</p><timestamp>00:17:10</timestamp>
<p>-They are!
-Well, that's politics for you.
</p><timestamp>00:17:12</timestamp>
<p>-It is!
-Hey, man. Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:17:16</timestamp>
<p>-What's going on?
-We're here for the party.
</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>We brought a plant.
</p><timestamp>00:17:20</timestamp>
<p>Look... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle> BoJack,
don't make me ask you to leave.
</p><timestamp>00:17:24</timestamp>
<p>-You don't have to--
-Come on, dude. Let us in.
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>-This plant's heavy as tits.
-I don't want a whole thing here.
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>My mom is coming
and I haven't spoken to her in ten years,
and I can't risk anything happening.
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>What do you think is going to "happen"?
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>I don't know, man,
but something always happens with you
and usually I've been cool because I know
you're always dealing with your own shit,
but I can't risk it tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:17:46</timestamp>
<p>I'm sober. Nothing is going to happen.
</p><timestamp>00:17:48</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, bro, what do you think's gonna--
Oh, shit.
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:17:54</timestamp>
<p>I'll see you around.
</p><timestamp>00:17:58</timestamp>
<p>We spent like 30 bucks on that plant.
</p><timestamp>00:18:03</timestamp>
<p>Yes, I have made mistakes. So, now what?
I'm just supposed to go away forever?
</p><timestamp>00:18:08</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.
</p><timestamp>00:18:10</timestamp>
<p>This is where you find out
who your real friends are.
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p>Part of being sober is leaving behind
all the people
who can't stop seeing you as the person
who pissed in the fountain
</p><timestamp>00:18:17</timestamp>
<p>-at my own daughter's sweet 16.
-Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>You think you owe them something
because they tolerated you at your worst,
but these people enjoy seeing you fail
because it lets them feel superior.
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>
<p>They don't know how to process it
when you're no longer the huge screw-up
who hijacked a Meals On Wheels van
to bring my friends to a strip club.
</p><timestamp>00:18:33</timestamp>
<p>-I don't know--
-I do. You know what else I know?
</p><timestamp>00:18:36</timestamp>
<p>You gotta go where the love is.
</p><timestamp>00:18:38</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Maybe.
</p><timestamp>00:18:40</timestamp>
<p>That's why we gotta make "Horny Unicorn."
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>Because it's gonna make a billion dollars
and drive all those assholes crazy!
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p>It would be good to have something
to keep me busy.
</p><timestamp>00:18:48</timestamp>
<p>See? That's what I'm talking about!
</p><timestamp>00:18:50</timestamp>
<p>-There he is! There's my Horn-corn!

</p><timestamp>00:18:53</timestamp>

-What is it?
</p><timestamp>00:18:55</timestamp>
<p>You mind if we swing by EWE.S.C.
real quick?
</p><timestamp>00:18:57</timestamp>
<p>EWE.S.C.? I'm trying to keep
a low profile.
</p><timestamp>00:18:59</timestamp>
<p>-I don't think a college campus--
-BoJack, this is my daughter, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:19:02</timestamp>
<p>She's the one person I care about,
the one thing keeping me sober.
</p><timestamp>00:19:05</timestamp>
<p>-Why do you need me to go with you?
-Unbelievable.
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p>When everyone else abandoned you,
who was there for you?
</p><timestamp>00:19:09</timestamp>
<p>When the world judged you
and ridiculed you?
</p><timestamp>00:19:11</timestamp>
<p>And now, the one time
I need something from you...
</p><timestamp>00:19:13</timestamp>
<p>Okay. I'm in.
</p><timestamp>00:19:15</timestamp>
<p>Or as the horny unicorn would say,
"Am I in?"
</p><timestamp>00:19:18</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you're in, baby!
</p><timestamp>00:19:21</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>video game noises</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p>No. No. Come on, come on,
come on! Come on!
</p><timestamp>00:19:27</timestamp>
<p>-What the hell, Diane?
-Ah! I'm working! I'm just taking a break.
</p><timestamp>00:19:30</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, you found my book?
-Yeah, and it sucked. Totally unrealistic.
</p><timestamp>00:19:34</timestamp>
<p>-You read my book?
-I've been reading it.
</p><timestamp>00:19:36</timestamp>
<p>Obviously, I wasn't gonna say it
in front of my friends,
because it's a book for girl babies,
but anyways it didn't even make sense!
</p><timestamp>00:19:41</timestamp>
<p>What do you mean?
</p><timestamp>00:19:42</timestamp>
<p>Like, you say the book takes place
in Chicago, but Ivy lives in Schaumburg.
</p><timestamp>00:19:46</timestamp>
<p>Schaumburg, Diane?
Schaumburg's not Chicago.
</p><timestamp>00:19:49</timestamp>
<p>It's in the Chicago metropolitan--
</p><timestamp>00:19:51</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, what's next?!
Evanston, Chicago?
</p><timestamp>00:19:55</timestamp>
<p>Morton Grove, Chicago?
Naperville, Chicago?
</p><timestamp>00:19:59</timestamp>
<p>-That's what you sound like!
-Okay, it's not too late to change it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>Good. And while you're at it,
</p><timestamp>00:20:04</timestamp>
<p>-I've got some other questions.
-Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:20:06</timestamp>
<p>Like, okay. When Ivy told Moose
that he wasn't her best friend anymore
and Moose said,
"You're still <i>my</i> best friend
whether you like it or not..." <subtitle>sniffs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:15</timestamp>
<p>-was that real?
-What do you mean?
</p><timestamp>00:20:17</timestamp>
<p>Like, did that really happen,
that someone could be
someone's best friend still
even when they're disappointed in them?
</p><timestamp>00:20:22</timestamp>
<p>Um, yeah, Sonny, that's real.
</p><timestamp>00:20:25</timestamp>
<p>Okay. And you know how Ivy
kept her dad's watch in her locker
because even though he wasn't around
she still knew that he loved her?
</p><timestamp>00:20:33</timestamp>
<p>-Was that real, too?
-Well, the book is fiction.
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, no, I get it, I just...
parts of it felt real, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I know.
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>It's cool that you wrote a book.
I mean, I think girls are gonna like it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:44</timestamp>
<p>Especially girls who, like,
don't have good self-esteem.
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>-I hope so.
-So, when's the next one coming out?
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>Just in case you need me to check it
for other mistakes, you know. <subtitle>sniffs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:53</timestamp>
<p>Well, if I get started right away,
it should be out by next fall.
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>-Cool. You gotta flip it.
-Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit!
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>-Jagger! Jagger!
-Shh, shh.
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, keep it down maybe?
</p><timestamp>00:21:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, Dad,
is this seriously happening?
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>-Why are you here?
-You knew what you were doing
when you liked
your mother's Instagram post
of her on the beach
with her new boyfriend.
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-It was a good picture!
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>That's why we're here?
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>Every month,
you get five Instagram likes on my account
and five on your mother's account.
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p>You heard what the judge mandated!
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p>Hey, man, let's just go. Okay?
People are starting to--
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>-Are you BoJack Horseman?
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, you are.
-NoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:21:31</timestamp>
<p>Were you trying to get my attention?
'Cause you got it now, baby!
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>-Dad!
-The story got picked up by TMZ!
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p>You're ruining my life!
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>You're making me look like
a real cuck, Jagger.
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>I'm getting cucked by my own daughter!
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>You don't even know what that word means!
</p><timestamp>00:21:44</timestamp>
<p>I just want you to know,
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>-I think you got a real bum deal.
-Oh, yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>You got massively sandbagged
in that interview, bro.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>-You were trying to apologize.
-Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>Everything these days is all
"patriarchy" this and "male gaze" that.
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>And, well, I think it's cool
 you're pushing back against that.
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>
<p>Well, no, I'm not pushing back.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>No, Bo, I'm saying it's cool.
You can relax here. This is a safe space.
</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-You're embarrassing me!
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah? How's this for embarrassing?
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>Your last spon-con post for L'Oréal?
It came off as disingenuous!
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasps</subtitle> You know I love my wide array
of L'Oréal products!
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>From game days with the gals
to cram sessions at the creamery,
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>L'Oréal gives me the confidence
to shine my brightest!
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>Do you wanna come back to Delta House?
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>I think those guys
would be super-stoked to meet you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>-They'd be stoked?
-Super-stoked.
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>All right, let's get out of here.
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>My daughter sucks, which is surprising
because I did such a good job raising her.
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>Let's make one more stop.
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>-Hey! Looking good!
-Well, that's politics for you!
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>phone buzzes, beeps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>-Hello?
-Your mother isn't feeling well.
</p><timestamp>00:22:45</timestamp>
<p>She's still recovering from her surgery.
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p>Does that mean you're not coming
to my refined, upscale party
that I totally didn't just throw together
only to impress you?
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, uh, no.
But thank you for inviting us.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>Jorge, I'm trying to connect to her.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>I know. Please keep trying.
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>beeps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>I'm starting to think that smart phones
are actually making us less connected.
</p><timestamp>00:23:17</timestamp>
<p>And then I passed out in the pool.
Sploosh!
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p>Luckily, Lindsay Lohan was there
to perform CPR.
</p><timestamp>00:23:23</timestamp>
<p>She still credits me for being the reason
she got sober... that time.
</p><timestamp>00:23:26</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Wow.
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>-Who's Lindsay Lohan?
-She's a celebrity from the olden days.
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p>Olden days? Jesus.
</p><timestamp>00:23:33</timestamp>
<p>Hey, look, buddy, I gotta go.
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna walk this co-ed back
to her room.
</p><timestamp>00:23:36</timestamp>
<p>'Cause, you know, there's pervs out there.
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>Are you serious?
You're supposed to be my sponsor.
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p>So, what, I gotta hang out
with you all the time?
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>Relax, okay? I'll call you tomorrow,
we'll set up "Horny Unicorn."
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>Enjoy your people.
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>camera shutter clicks</subtitle>
-Hey, man. Hey! No pictures!
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>-Delete that.
-Come on.
</p><timestamp>00:23:53</timestamp>
<p>Hey, no. You come on.
I'm not here to be your cool story later.
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>Okay, sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>I shouldn't be here.
