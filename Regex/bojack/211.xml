<p>What are you doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:00:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You said if I was in town
to give you a call.
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>-Wanna get a drink?
-It's eight in the morning.
</p><timestamp>00:00:18</timestamp>
<p>It's 5:00 p.m. in Los Angeles.
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>-That's not true.
-I don't know what time it is.
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>When's the last time you slept?
You look like shit.
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>Really? 'Cause you look like a million...
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, let's get you back to my place.
-What about the store?
</p><timestamp>00:00:31</timestamp>
<p>What if somebody has an emergency
and they need more...
turquoise shit?
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>It's New Mexico.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>They'll find it.
</p><timestamp>00:00:37</timestamp>
<p>-It's really good to see you.
-It's good to see you, too.
</p><timestamp>00:00:40</timestamp>
<p>I can't wait for you
to meet Kyle and the kids.
</p><timestamp>00:00:42</timestamp>
<p>Kyle and the kids? Please tell me
that's the name of your band.

<p>So, who are you again?
</p><timestamp>00:01:22</timestamp>
<p>You were friends with Mom
when she lived in L.A.?
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Your mom never mentioned she used
to hang out with <i>the</i> BoJack Horseman?
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Star of screen and... book?
</p><timestamp>00:01:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Wait, Mom lived in Los Angeles?
-Never came up?
</p><timestamp>00:01:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-All these years?
-It was a long time ago.
</p><timestamp>00:01:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, gross. Mom, Trip has a boner again.
</p><timestamp>00:01:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Trip.
-Trip, let's dial back the boners.
</p><timestamp>00:01:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Gross.
-What? I can't help it.
</p><timestamp>00:01:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Trip, ew.
-You are at the breakfast table
</p><timestamp>00:01:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}with your parents, your big sister,
and an old man.
</p><timestamp>00:01:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What could possibly be arousing you?
-Am I the old man?
</p><timestamp>00:01:49</timestamp>
<p>I don't understand how it works.
</p><timestamp>00:01:51</timestamp>
<p>I was just excited that I finished
the maze on the back of the cereal box.
</p><timestamp>00:01:54</timestamp>
<p>So, BoJack. What brings you to Tesuque?
</p><timestamp>00:01:56</timestamp>
<p>So, we're just gonna change
the subject
and pretend Trip isn't being a huge perv
right now?
</p><timestamp>00:02:01</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, Penny, that's the plan.
</p><timestamp>00:02:03</timestamp>
<p>Talking about it makes it worse.
It likes attention.
</p><timestamp>00:02:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Charlotte told me if I was ever
in New Mexico
</p><timestamp>00:02:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I should call her.
-But what are you doing in New Mexico?
</p><timestamp>00:02:10</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, what <i>are</i> you doing in New Mexico?
-I, uh...
</p><timestamp>00:02:13</timestamp>
<p>You didn't drive all this way
just to see my mom, did you?
</p><timestamp>00:02:16</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> No, of course not.
</p><timestamp>00:02:18</timestamp>
<p>That would be crazy,
to come all this way just to see a woman
</p><timestamp>00:02:22</timestamp>
<p>I haven't had a real conversation with
in 30 years.
</p><timestamp>00:02:25</timestamp>
<p>-I mean, obviously, that would be crazy.
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:02:28</timestamp>
<p>-Because she has a family, which is great.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:02:31</timestamp>
<p>-You guys are great.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:02:33</timestamp>
<p>So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.
</p><timestamp>00:02:36</timestamp>
<p>-Mm.
-On my way to see...
</p><timestamp>00:02:39</timestamp>
<p>-On your way to sea?
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:02:40</timestamp>
<p>To the sea. To the shining sea.
</p><timestamp>00:02:43</timestamp>
<p>Because I'm here to buy... a boat.
</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>-At the... Santa Fe Boat Show.
-I've never heard of a Santa Fe Boat Show.
</p><timestamp>00:02:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's 'cause... it's a secret boat show.
</p><timestamp>00:02:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Invitation-only.
-Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:02:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries
and big-time celebrities and... kings.
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Wow.
-<subtitle>Penny</subtitle> Hold up.
</p><timestamp>00:02:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}If you live in Los Angeles,
which is right on the ocean,
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}why would you drive all the way here
to go to a boat show
</p><timestamp>00:03:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-in the middle of landlocked New Mexico?
-Jeez, so many questions.
</p><timestamp>00:03:07</timestamp>

<p>{\an8}Oh, gotta take this.
It's my... boat... guy.
</p><timestamp>00:03:16</timestamp>
<p>-Hello?
-Okay, so I got Turtel--
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Knute.
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>-You got any leads for me, boat-wise?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sounds perfect, Knute.
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Now tell me, do we need a poop deck?
-Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>-Well, if Leo has one, then I want one.
-BoJack--
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}In fact, I want two, two poop decks.
Sorry about that. What's going on?
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>-Where the hell are you?
-Tesuque.
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>-Te-who-ka?
-Tesuque, New Mexico.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>-Outside Santa Fe.
-Are you te-stupid?
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>If you don't get your ass back te-set,
you're gonna get te-sued.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>-Just get me a couple of days.
-For what? What are you doing there?
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I don't know, I just... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}This isn't what I expected.
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>Well, I can probably stave them off
till Monday if you get pinkeye.
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>-Can you get pinkeye?
-I have to go.
</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>
<p>Wait, BoJack, when are you coming back?
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Soon. Yep, I want the starboard
</p><timestamp>00:03:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-to be fully starboard.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>-And the port to be... also starboard.
-Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:04:03</timestamp>
<p>-Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
<i>-Wait, BoJack--</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>-Hey.
-I'm really glad you're here.
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah... uh, me, too.
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p>I hope this isn't weird for you.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>You know, me having a family and--
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>Why would it be weird? <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>At our age,
it's weird if you don't have a family.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>-I mean...
-Well, not for you.
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-'Cause you've been busy.
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>-Right.
-With your career.
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>Sure, yeah,
my career has kept me super busy.
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, I know you're just in town
for the boat show,
but seriously... make yourself at home.
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>I really don't want to impose.
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>If there's anything I can do
to help around here--
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>Mom, Dad was supposed to take me driving
after school today,
but now he's gotta take Trip
to his dumb-ass basketball game.
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>-It's the quarter-finals.
-You'll just get a hard-on in the game.
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>Now I will get a hard-on because
you made me think about it. Thanks a lot.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>-I'll take you driving this weekend.
-I need to practice every day.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>I'm the only senior
who still doesn't have a license.
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>It's embarrassing.
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>Well, I got the store,
and I already took the morning off,
so unless you know any other adults...
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>Can BoJack take me?
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>-Huh?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>-I mean, he is an adult.
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>Well, I mean, if it's okay with BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>You'd really be doing me a huge favor.
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>Well, I guess I could make some time...
before the boat show.
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>Keep your eyes on the road,
both hands on the wheel.
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-And don't text and drive,
unless it's an emergency,
like you have a really funny thing
that you just have to text someone.
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>-Got it.
-So, let me ask you something. Tsk.
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>Do your parents really love each other,
or is it
a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>What? Why would you ask me that?
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. Just making conversation.
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>-Why do we keep passing the same house?
-No, I don't. Shut up.
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>You shut up. What's the story?
Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>College kid that gives you Adderall?
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>Okay, fine.
</p><timestamp>00:05:46</timestamp>
<p>That's Diego Mendoza's house.
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>He's just this stupid guy.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>He's in my calculus class,
and sometimes we'll do this thing
where he goes, "Hey,"
and then I go, "Hey."
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>Then he goes, "What's the homework?"
and I tell him.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>It's not like a big deal or anything,
but it's like this thing we do.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>-Cool thing.
-So, anyway...
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>My best friend, Alison F.</i>
<i>was talking to Rachel Kaplan.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle><i> Do I really need</i>
<i>to know these names?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>Penny</subtitle><i> Rachel heard from Ray-Ray</i>
<i>and the Bean</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>that Diego said</i>
<i>if prom happened right now</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>he'd want to go with Ali Sandler,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>"Yeah, pfft, okay, dude."
You know what I mean?
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>You know I don't know
any of these people, right?
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>But then he said
since prom's not for another two months,
he could "foresee a situation"
where he would want to go with me,
because he knows I'm a real girl
who's mostly chill. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>If you're so mostly chill,
why do you keep driving by his house?
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>In case he comes out,
to, like, check the mail or something.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>I'll get out of the car and be like,
"That's so funny.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>I was just going for a drive."
</p><timestamp>00:06:39</timestamp>
<p>And he'll be like, "Oh, hey."
And I'll be like, "Hey."
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>
<p>-'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.
-That's the whole plan?
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>Well, it's better than your plan
for buying a boat in New Mexico.
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>Dude, what are you really doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p>I didn't... like the person I was in L.A.
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>And I didn't know where else to go.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>-Please do not tell your parents.
-Well, I won't,
but I think people are gonna notice
if you go to a boat show
and don't come back with a boat.
</p><timestamp>00:07:09</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, there he is. Get down!
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God. Oh!
-What are you doing?
</p><timestamp>00:07:13</timestamp>
<p>-What happened to your plan?
-Oh! I panicked.
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>I didn't know
he'd be wearing a tank top. <subtitle>screams</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:21</timestamp>
<p>-Don't tell my parents I crashed your car.
-Yeah, deal.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>-They didn't even put me in.
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle> I'm sorry, sweetheart.
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>You did some great cheering
from the bench,
and for someone who never plays,
you sweat a lot.
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p>-Maybe they'll put me in next game.
-Sure, they will.
</p><timestamp>00:07:38</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>whispering</subtitle> No way they'll do that.

<p>What a boat.
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>-Can I go on your boat?
-I don't see what's stopping you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>Yeah! Woo-hoo! I'm going on a boat!
I got my way!
</p><timestamp>00:07:51</timestamp>
<p>Where's your car?
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>I junked it.
Who needs a car when you got a boat?
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>-Uh... well--
-<subtitle>Trip</subtitle> Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>On a boat!
Think of the amount of floating!
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p>Please stay out of the bedroom.
</p><timestamp>00:08:03</timestamp>
<p>-Does she have a name?
-Who?
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>-The boat? It does not.
-Come on. You gotta give her a name.
</p><timestamp>00:08:08</timestamp>
<p>You should call her the <i>Escape From L.A.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>That actually is a good name for <i>it,</i>
the nongendered object.
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>Oh, she's a good girl.
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> I can tell,
she's a good girl, isn't she?
</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>-Or are you a bad girl?
-Are you flirting with my boat right now?
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>No, just kidding around.
I'm kind of the comedian of the family.
</p><timestamp>00:08:24</timestamp>
<p>-Mind if I get on top of her?
-Knock yourself out.
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>Dad, don't be gross.
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>-Wow, you really got a boat.
-Yeah, sure did.
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>So, does that mean you're leaving?
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I, uh...
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I guess, uh... I guess I did...
do what I came here to do.
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>You don't have to go right away, right?
At least stay till the end of the weekend.
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.
-Oh, it's no bother.
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>And at least now you have your own bed.
Besides... heh, everyone here loves you.
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>Uh, everyone?
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>Jill Pill? I don't care about this.
</p><timestamp>00:09:06</timestamp>
<p>Okay, moving on. Do you remember
when we were at Herb's funeral
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>-and you told me--?
-Whatever it is, I don't care.
</p><timestamp>00:09:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Trip</subtitle> Oh, there's a kitchen!
Can we make pizza bagels?
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>

<p>Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back
on set Monday.
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>What? How long do I have
to keep putting out fires for you?
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Just let them burn.
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-I think I might be here a while.

</p><timestamp>00:09:41</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely,
they'll move the boat.

<p>BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah?
-Supper's ready.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>So, I had another meeting today
with the Drama Chair at SFCC.
</p><timestamp>00:09:58</timestamp>
<p>They're gonna offer me a position.
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>-What? That's amazing.
-Oh, that's cool. Congratulations.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>There's a real stick-in-the-mud dean there
who doesn't like my in-your-face style.
</p><timestamp>00:10:07</timestamp>
<p>If I know me, it might lead
to some pretty zany misadventures.
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.
</p><timestamp>00:10:13</timestamp>
<p>It's funny you brought up the Brussels
sprouts, because I think they're terrible.
</p><timestamp>00:10:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Kyle snorts, then laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>I'm just kidding around.
These are great, hon.

<p><subtitle>all laugh</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:22</timestamp>
<p>Penny, did you hear my bit
about the Brussels sprouts?
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>A <i>bit</i> is what they call a <i>joke</i>
in show business.
</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>
<p>-Right, BoJack?
-That's right.
</p><timestamp>00:10:29</timestamp>
<p>String a bunch of those together
and you got yourself a riff.
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle> You're not funny, Dad.
Your jokes are never funny.
</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>Okay... I think someone's in a mood.
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God. I'm not in a mood.
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p>Whatever. Get bent.
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>I hate my life. I can't wait to be dead.

</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack and Charlotte</subtitle> I'll talk to her.
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>Everyone said for months
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>-that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.
-Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>-But he keeps not doing it.
-That is so typical Diego.
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>So, I thought, okay,
if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>-Way to take initiative.
-Oh. Rookie mistake.
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>So, I asked him and he said no.
</p><timestamp>00:10:58</timestamp>
<p>And then this other girl, Lyla K.,
came up to him and was just like, "Hey."
</p><timestamp>00:11:02</timestamp>
<p>And he was like, "Hey."
And that's our thing.
</p><timestamp>00:11:05</timestamp>
<p>Well, I don't want to tell tales
out of school,
but this Lyla K. character
sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>Thank you, that is exactly what she is.
It's weird that nobody talks about it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:15</timestamp>
<p>Well, you know, sometimes it's nice
to not have a date,
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>-because you can actually--
-Mom.
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>I can't go to the prom without a date.
It's not like when you were in high school
</p><timestamp>00:11:23</timestamp>
<p>-and you'd go to your sock hops.
-Do you think
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p>-I went to high school in the '50s?
-Penny, hey, I got an idea.
</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p>-You should take me to the prom.
-Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>Everybody loves having BoJack around.
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>What? Why?
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>Think about it. If you went with Diego,
you'd be nervous.
</p><timestamp>00:11:36</timestamp>
<p><i>"Does he like me? Am I cool?"</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p><i>But with me you can just relax</i>

</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p><i>Diego will see you</i>

</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p><i>and that'll make him super jealous.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p><i>So, he'll come up to you,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p><i>And then you say, "Hey."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, that's so cold.
-Right?
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>-Wait--
-Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.
</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>-How is that cold?
-Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?"
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p><i>And you'll say,</i>
<i>"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p><i>And then... never dance with him.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:01</timestamp>
<p>-That'll show him.
-Wait-- I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:12:04</timestamp>
<p>-Don't you want to dance with Diego?
-Stop poking holes, Charlotte.
</p><timestamp>00:12:06</timestamp>
<p>-This is a great plan.
-Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Dad, BoJack's taking me to prom!
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>Oh, <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> yeah, well,
that's definitely the better idea.
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Kyle</subtitle> Okay, everyone smile. Real big.
</p><timestamp>00:12:20</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all</subtitle> Cheese.
-I think we have enough pictures.
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh, come on, it's your first prom.
Indulge us.
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>Taking pictures before prom
is so bourgeois.
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>And who are you again?
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>-I'm Maddy.
-Maddy's my best friend.
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>-I thought Alison F. was your best friend.
-That was like three best friends ago.
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>snickers</subtitle> You were best friends
with Alison F.?
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-Hey, BoJack, I'm Pete.
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>But they call me Pete Repeat
because I always say everything twice.
</p><timestamp>00:12:47</timestamp>
<p>-Everything?
-Yeah, it's kind of my thing.
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-Ah, damn.
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>I forgot to say that twice, didn't I?
Usually I do it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>

<p>Ugh. Red Bull and vodka? What are you, 12?
You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.

<p>Do they teach you anything in school?
Make a left at the light.
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>-Where are we going?
-I'll get you some bourbon.
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>And you'll cut it with water.
That way you don't get hungover.
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>Wait, really?
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>If you're gonna drink,
you should be smart about it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:27</timestamp>
<p>Awesome. Wait.
How many times did I just say "awesome"?
</p><timestamp>00:13:30</timestamp>
<p>Was it twice or was it once?
Ah, it was probably twice.
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p>Why is there an adult
at our high school prom?
</p><timestamp>00:14:10</timestamp>
<p>All right, folks.
We're taking it back to 1991,
when a new funky-fresh dance craze
took this nation by storm.
</p><timestamp>00:14:16</timestamp>
<p>-All right. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>

<p>Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat,
and here... we... go. Waka waka.

if you wanna do the BoJack,

</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>Or we could go back to the car
and just leave.
</p><timestamp>00:14:48</timestamp>
<p>-You can't just leave the prom.
-Of course you can. You're young.
</p><timestamp>00:14:51</timestamp>
<p>You can do whatever you want.
</p><timestamp>00:14:53</timestamp>
<p>That's what they never tell you
until it's too late.
You don't have to be here.
</p><timestamp>00:14:57</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, is right. Society is everywhere.
</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>-Society.

</p><timestamp>00:15:03</timestamp>
<p>I'd say it's time to get down,
time to hit the town.
</p><timestamp>00:15:05</timestamp>

<p>I don't know. It just came to me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:49</timestamp>
<p>I'm really glad we left that stupid prom,
but I'm kind of bummed
we didn't get to dance.
</p><timestamp>00:15:55</timestamp>
<p>Well, you wanna dance?
</p><timestamp>00:15:57</timestamp>
<p>Yes, hold on.

<p>I think you should come down here.

<p>She's still breathing,
but she won't wake up.
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>She just had too much to drink.
Take her back to your place.
</p><timestamp>00:16:25</timestamp>
<p>-She can spend the night.
-Maddy, come on.
</p><timestamp>00:16:27</timestamp>
<p>No, look, my cousin had a friend
who passed out like this,
and she died of alcohol poisoning, man.
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p>I really think we should get Maddy
to a hospital, to a hospital.
</p><timestamp>00:16:36</timestamp>
<p>Did you see what I did there?
That's why they call me Pete Repeat.
</p><timestamp>00:16:39</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, what do we do?
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>tires screech</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:47</timestamp>
<p>-Society.
-Careful.
</p><timestamp>00:16:49</timestamp>
<p>-I'm being careful.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>-Lock the wheels.
-Watch her head.
</p><timestamp>00:16:52</timestamp>
<p>Maddy's gonna be just fine.
They'll know what to do here.
</p><timestamp>00:16:54</timestamp>
<p>Pete, you're in charge.
</p><timestamp>00:16:56</timestamp>
<p>-Penny and I are gonna take off.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p>You don't want too many people around
in a hospital setting.
</p><timestamp>00:17:01</timestamp>
<p>If anyone asks,
tell them we left the dance early,
and you don't know
where Maddy got the whiskey.
</p><timestamp>00:17:06</timestamp>
<p>Why?
</p><timestamp>00:17:07</timestamp>
<p>It's one thing if a bunch of kids
get drunk on prom night,
but if there's an adult there,
I was supposed to be responsible,
and then the whole thing feels
kind of creepy.
</p><timestamp>00:17:15</timestamp>
<p>Are you sure she's gonna be okay?
</p><timestamp>00:17:16</timestamp>
<p>-I don't know, BoJack.
-Pete.
</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>I'm the adult here,
and I need you to listen to me.
</p><timestamp>00:17:21</timestamp>
<p>Penny and I left early.
You don't know who gave Maddy whiskey.
</p><timestamp>00:17:24</timestamp>
<p>Are we clear on this?
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>I need you to be 100 percent with me here.
</p><timestamp>00:17:27</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>Just listen to him.
He knows what he's doing.
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>It's gonna be okay.
Where did Maddy get the alcohol from?
</p><timestamp>00:17:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Maddy groaning</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>I... I don't know.

BoJack and Penny?

</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>-Uh... "okay" okay.

<p>It's a part of growing up.
</p><timestamp>00:18:04</timestamp>
<p>And we did the right thing back there,
you think?
</p><timestamp>00:18:07</timestamp>
<p>I... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
Look, sometimes when you're an adult,
the right thing
isn't always the best thing.
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p>Well...
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>I had a really good time tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:18:17</timestamp>
<p>Even with all the craziness.
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>This was really special.
</p><timestamp>00:18:21</timestamp>
<p>I'm glad.
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p>You know, everyone always treats me
like a kid.
</p><timestamp>00:18:25</timestamp>
<p>You're the first grown-up I've ever met
who actually treats me like...
you know, a person.
</p><timestamp>00:18:30</timestamp>
<p>So, thanks. Mwah.
</p><timestamp>00:18:33</timestamp>
<p>-Well, you're welcome, Penny.
-Mm--
</p><timestamp>00:18:35</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa, Penny, come on.
-If you want to do it, I'm ready.
</p><timestamp>00:18:38</timestamp>
<p>I have condoms in my room.
I can put one on with my mouth.
</p><timestamp>00:18:41</timestamp>
<p>-With your mouth?
-I put one on a banana in health class.
</p><timestamp>00:18:43</timestamp>
<p>With your mouth?
What kind of health class--?
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p>Look, you are an amazing person,
but you're 17.
</p><timestamp>00:18:49</timestamp>
<p>Which is the legal age of consent
in New Mexico.
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>Okay, that's not--
</p><timestamp>00:18:52</timestamp>
<p>And I didn't drink tonight,
so everything's totally legal.
</p><timestamp>00:18:55</timestamp>
<p>-Penny, no.
-It's okay. I want this.
</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>No, you think you do, but...
</p><timestamp>00:19:01</timestamp>
<p>You don't know what you want.
</p><timestamp>00:19:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God. <subtitle>sniffs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:06</timestamp>
<p>This is so dumb.
</p><timestamp>00:19:08</timestamp>
<p>-No, Penny, don't--
-I'll see you tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:19:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>
<p>Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:19:19</timestamp>
<p>-What'd you do with my daughter?
-She had a big night.
</p><timestamp>00:19:21</timestamp>
<p>She was falling asleep on the ride home.
Where are the boys?
</p><timestamp>00:19:24</timestamp>
<p>Trip's at a friend's house
and Kyle's asleep.
</p><timestamp>00:19:28</timestamp>
<p>-You know you can get your own, right?
-Hey, do you remember that time
you, me and Herb let those balloons go
over Studio City?
</p><timestamp>00:19:34</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah. Didn't we attach glow sticks
to them or something?
</p><timestamp>00:19:37</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah.
-Ooh. That was really bad
for the environment.
</p><timestamp>00:19:39</timestamp>
<p>-True, but--
-A seagull could've choked
</p><timestamp>00:19:41</timestamp>
<p>-on one of those balloons.
-But it's a nice memory, right?
</p><timestamp>00:19:44</timestamp>
<p>It was a fun night.
</p><timestamp>00:19:46</timestamp>
<p>We had a lot of fun nights.
</p><timestamp>00:19:48</timestamp>
<p>Before you left town,
you told me L.A. was a tar pit.
</p><timestamp>00:19:51</timestamp>
<p>-Do you remember?
-Oh, God.
</p><timestamp>00:19:53</timestamp>
<p>I said so many things when I was young.
I thought I was so deep.
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>-Well, do you still think it's true?
-Do I think L.A. is a tar pit?
</p><timestamp>00:20:00</timestamp>
<p>No.
</p><timestamp>00:20:01</timestamp>
<p>No, I think you're the tar pit.
</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>-Me?
-No, not "you" you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm just saying, like...
</p><timestamp>00:20:08</timestamp>
<p>It doesn't matter where you are,
it's who you are,
and that's not gonna change
whether you're in California
or Maine or New Mexico.
</p><timestamp>00:20:17</timestamp>
<p>You know, you can't escape... you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:19</timestamp>
<p>-Ugh. Now you sound like my mother.
-No, what? No, I don't. <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Charlotte sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>
<p>-I don't know what to do, Charlotte.
-About what?
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p>I keep... making these bad decisions.
</p><timestamp>00:20:33</timestamp>
<p>-And hurting people.
-Well...
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>-Can I tell you a joke?
-Is it a long joke with no punch line?
</p><timestamp>00:20:39</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-Then go ahead.
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>Guy goes into the doctor's office.
Says, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this."
</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>You know what the doctor says?
</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p>-"Don't do that."
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>-That's actually... good advice.
-And you know what else?
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>
<p>The doctor in that story was a woman.
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>What?!

</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>Oh. BoJack, um...
</p><timestamp>00:21:07</timestamp>
<p>-I think you got the wrong idea.
-Let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>-Let's get out of here right now.
-No, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>You and me, this is real.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>-You know this is real.
-My husband is right upstairs.
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>-Don't do this, BoJack.
-I know you feel it, too.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>So many times in my life
I've done the wrong thing,
but this is the right thing,
and I have never been more sure
of anything.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>I've wasted so much time sitting
on my hands
and imagining what could have been.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Charlotte sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>-I think you should go.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p>-Tomorrow.
-Charlotte--
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>I have worked very hard to build this life
for myself.
</p><timestamp>00:21:44</timestamp>
<p>I am happy here.
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>And you just roll into my life
like a hurricane.
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>Why? Because we knew each other
for five minutes 30 years ago?
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>-I don't know you.
-You do.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>I don't. And you don't know me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>No, please.
These last few months have been amazing.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>-I love you, your family and this town.
-Stop.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>-I never wanted to hurt--
-BoJack--
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>-Everything can go back to normal, but--
-No, no, stop. No.
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>Please, don't make me go back to L.A.
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>I don't care where you go, BoJack,
but I can't have you around here.
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>You make me too sad.
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>What are you doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>I know what I want, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>Go to bed, Penny.

<p>-Charlotte.
-Penny, go to your room.
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p>-We didn't even do anything.
-Now, Penny.
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Penny crying</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:17</timestamp>
<p>-Charlotte, I am so sorry--
-Don't. Don't you dare.
</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>If you are not out of my driveway
in 30 minutes, I will call the police.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>And if you ever try to contact me
or my family again,
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p>I will fucking kill you.
