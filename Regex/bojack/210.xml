<p>Aw, she looks so peaceful.
</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p>Think she's dreaming that
she's not overstaying her welcome?
</p><timestamp>00:00:20</timestamp>
<p>When she got that wine delivered
to the house,
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>I thought that was her thank-you present,
that she was leaving,
</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>-but then she just drank the wine.
-Five days ago.
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>-Morning, everybody.
-Aah! Kinko!
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>Another beautiful day
in the city of Brotherly Angels.
</p><timestamp>00:00:33</timestamp>
<p>Todd, I don't recall
accidentally ingesting poison,
and yet here you are
trying to make me vomit.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>You wanna go buy me a kite
and then fly a kite?
</p><timestamp>00:00:41</timestamp>
<p>No. Kites are sky trash.
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
Why is it so daytime right now?
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p>Wanda?
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groaning</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>Wanna go surf some cloud waves?
That's what I call wind.
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>Sorry. Some of us have jobs.
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>Not all of us. Just some of us.
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah, my job.
</p><timestamp>00:01:02</timestamp>
<p>-Morning.
-<subtitle>J.D.</subtitle> What?
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>I'm done with my sabbatical
and I'm ready to get back to work.
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p>What sabbatical? I fired you.
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I thought
when you said, "You're fired,"
that was just you
"giving me the business."
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>No, I was taking the "business"
away from you.
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You wanna go fly a kite?
</p><timestamp>00:01:21</timestamp>
<p>Put me down
for a supersized "sounds great."
</p><timestamp>00:01:23</timestamp>
<p>But with an even larger main course
of "sadly, I cannot."
</p><timestamp>00:01:26</timestamp>
<p>I am swamped here at work.
First, I gotta put my suit on.
</p><timestamp>00:01:30</timestamp>
<p>Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>Then we record the show.
</p><timestamp>00:01:34</timestamp>
<p>And then I gotta take my suit off.
</p><timestamp>00:01:36</timestamp>
<p>So, that's, like, the whole day. Sorry.

<p>Ah.
</p><timestamp>00:01:45</timestamp>
<p>"Looking for a friend?"
</p><timestamp>00:01:46</timestamp>
<p>Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:01:47</timestamp>
<p>"Need direction?"
</p><timestamp>00:01:48</timestamp>
<p>I'm listening.
</p><timestamp>00:01:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"Try Scientology"?
</p><timestamp>00:01:52</timestamp>
<p>-Huh.
-Excuse me? Sir?
</p><timestamp>00:01:54</timestamp>
<p>-Huh?
-Have you ever thought
about trying improv comedy?
</p><timestamp>00:01:58</timestamp>
<p>Improv comedy? I don't know...
</p><timestamp>00:02:02</timestamp>
<p>Why not?
It's not like there's anything else to do.
</p><timestamp>00:02:04</timestamp>
<p>Here on Mars.
</p><timestamp>00:02:06</timestamp>
<p>We're on Mars?
</p><timestamp>00:02:07</timestamp>
<p>Yes. And in a Martian ice cream shop.
Care for a butterscotch swirl?
</p><timestamp>00:02:12</timestamp>
<p>Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:02:13</timestamp>
<p>The only limit is my imagination.
</p><timestamp>00:02:16</timestamp>
<p>Why not come by our theater
and try a free class?
</p><timestamp>00:02:19</timestamp>
<p>Okay!
Can I bring this food inside the theater?
</p><timestamp>00:02:23</timestamp>
<p>Ha, good one.
</p><timestamp>00:02:24</timestamp>
<p>-But no.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:02:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>♪♪</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"That's when I learned
that guns can blow a <i>vato </i>away.
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But calculus?
Calculus can blow a mind away."
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Abe</subtitle> Cut!
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>We got it!
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's the day, everybody.
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>slurping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p>-You sure we got it, Abe?
-Of course. You were phenomenal.
</p><timestamp>00:03:40</timestamp>
<p>Really? Because that kid sneezed
in the middle of my monologue.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-We can fix that in post.
-Abe, I'm supposed to tell you
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}the boom mike fell into the last shot.
</p><timestamp>00:03:48</timestamp>
<p>You sure you don't wanna get another take?
Just for safety?
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What am I, Kubrick?
We can fix all this stuff in post.
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It's an easy scene.
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Secretariat's a nice guy,
the Spanish kids learn a lesson.
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Boom. Bam! Done!
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But Secretariat never actually taught math
in South Central.
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I don't know what Secretariat did
or didn't do. I wasn't there.
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Yeah, but--
-Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers,
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}we'll give them gangbangers.
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-We get paid either way, right?
-I guess.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I can't wait to get home.
I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You like coq au vin?
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I think so. Is that the move
where a French girl pours soup in--
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Come over for dinner, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-You'll love it.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Chin up, big guy.
So, we ain't making <i>Casablanca.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>slurping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-BoJack. Shut up.
-Aah! What are you--?
</p><timestamp>00:04:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No one can know I'm here.
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What?
-Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}As you know, you're my favorite client.
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}If I left Vigor,
would you follow me to a new agency?
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sure, but no one's gonna hire me
after this movie comes out.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The script turned into a piece of shit,
and the director is a total hack.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Good guy, total hack.
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Let's get you something
before the movie comes out.
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We got an offer in for this new play
off-Broadway.
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>Theater? That's what real actors do.
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I told them that,
but they said she wanted you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>-She?
-Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill Pill.
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>-She came out of nowhere.
-Jill Pill?
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p><i>New York Magazine </i>called her
the <i>enfant terrible</i>
of the immersive theater world,
and then later clarified
that that's a compliment.
</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p>It sounds like the kind of thing
I should be doing now.
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>-Something artistic and bold.
-Rehearsals start in two weeks.
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>Are you ready to go to New York
for six months?
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>New York's a great city to live in
for six months
and not a second longer and only
if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.
</p><timestamp>00:05:34</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all</subtitle> Apple sauce!
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>Oh-ho!
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>That was so funny.
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>Which one of you guys
wrote all those funny jokes?
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>No, Todd, here at Shenanigags,
we make things up on the spot.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>-Let's try it. Give me a suggestion.
-Uh... I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>Suggestions?
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>Your suggestion was "suggestions."
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>-Way to break the fourth wall.
-That wasn't that funny.
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>My name's Bryan
and you haven't won me over yet.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, Bryan.
-Todd, in improv,
we get suggestions from an audience
then make up scenes based on them.
</p><timestamp>00:06:03</timestamp>
<p>There are just a few simple rules.
You don't ask questions. You don't say no.
</p><timestamp>00:06:07</timestamp>
<p>No matter what. When someone makes a
suggestion, you always try to build on it.
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>We call that "yes, and..."
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.
It's all part of the fun.
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>Is it really that simple?
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>Ugh! It's incredibly complicated
and requires years of training.
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh, Bryan.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:26</timestamp>
<p>But improv isn't just about a constant
clamoring for attention and validation.
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p>It's about community.
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>I've always wanted to be part
of a community.
</p><timestamp>00:06:33</timestamp>
<p>Well, you are now.
Your first class is $200.
</p><timestamp>00:06:36</timestamp>
<p>I thought you said it was free.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that was just me doing an improv.
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>I am so proud of you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>Every day I'm telling people all about
the great stuff you're doing there.
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, I don't know--
-<i>And they say, "Wow, she sounds amazing."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>And I say, "I'm here to confirm
she is an incredible woman."
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p>-<i>Well--</i>
-You know, the sound guy's wife
works with at-risk teens.
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>And I was like, "Yeah, that's okay,
but compared to what my wife is doing,
</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p>-your wife is bullshit!"
-<i>Oh.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>And he had to agree with me.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>-Um--
-Because I am his boss.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>-Listen--
-<i>Let me talk to one of the locals.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:11</timestamp>
<p>I wanna hear someone else talk
about how what a selfless hero my wife is.
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, uh...
-Ah, now come on.
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>-Most refugees got their tongues cut out.
-Find one with a tongue.
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p>-<i>I don't think--</i>
-Indulge me.
</p><timestamp>00:07:21</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>in softer voice</subtitle>
Hello. I am refugee from village.
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>Hey, what's your name, Superstar?
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>Uh, my name is...
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p>Coffee Maker.
<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>Ah. Kofi Makir.
Am I pronouncing that right?
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Todd, you had some killer provs
in class today.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>Yes, and that zombie dentist scene
was so innovative.
</p><timestamp>00:07:51</timestamp>
<p>Eh...
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, Bryan.
-Guys, look.
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>It's Copernicus.
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>-Who's that?
-What are you, new?
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>Yes, I am new.
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>Copernicus is the founder of Shenanigags.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>That guy is the Jan-Ove Waldner
of modern improv.
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>-Who is Jan-Ove Waldner?
-The Michael Jordan of table tennis.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:08:08</timestamp>
<p>-Let's go talk to him.
-Are you kidding?
</p><timestamp>00:08:11</timestamp>
<p>You can't just go up and talk
to Copernicus.
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>Man, Todd, you don't know shit.
You're just a tourist.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>No, I'm not.
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>If you're one of us, prove it.
Go improv that lady over there.
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>Freestyle.
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>No audience, no net.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>-I don't know...
-Hey, if you're down with the prov,
you gotta prove that prov.
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>All right. I'll do it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>-Hello, old ma'am.
-Oh, hello.
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>I'm just waiting for my friend Doris.
Have you seen her?
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>Yes,
and she exploded?
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>Doris exploded?
</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>
<p>-You just got prov'd!
-In your face, lady!
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>The streets are ours!
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>-Hurray, improv! I did it!
-You have briefly won me over.
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>Poor Doris...
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>That is not what I thought coq au vin was.
But it's great.
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm no Emeril Lagasse,
but we do get by.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, stop. <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
-Bam!
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>Like Emeril? Ha, remember that?
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>He said "bam."
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>I don't know who Emeril is,
but he sounds delightful.
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>Hey, should I give him a sitcom?
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, Abe tells me
you guys are almost done with the movie.
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>One week left!
</p><timestamp>00:09:20</timestamp>
<p>You two lovebirds gonna do
any traveling or anything?
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>I'll be traveling back and forth
to New York for the next few months
because BoJack's doing a play there
after you finish.
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, I love plays.
-A play.
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>That's my favorite place
to eat crinkly candies.
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I can't wait to finally work
on something good, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>Oh?
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>Although I gotta hand it to your husband.
It has been a really painless shoot,
even though the movie's gonna be
a piece of shit, right?
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Oh, you said "piece of ship," right?
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>Like shipshape? <subtitle>giggles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, what were we talking about?
Who knows?
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, moving on.
-Hey, it's fine.
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>Abe knows what we're making.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>Right?
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Abe slurps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:56</timestamp>
<p>-Wanda, would you help me with dessert?
-Uh, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
New York is so great in the summer,
but I don't think
we're going to be done in time.
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>We're looking at a ton of reshoots.
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>-Are you kidding?
-Well, you know,
because the movie's such a piece of shit
and all.
</p><timestamp>00:10:16</timestamp>
<p>Did that hurt your feelings?
</p><timestamp>00:10:17</timestamp>
<p>I mean, you're the one who said
we're not making <i>Casablanca.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>Right, because <i>Casablanca </i>is a movie
about a club owner named Rick.
</p><timestamp>00:10:24</timestamp>
<p>This movie's about Secretariat,
a racehorse.
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>
<p>Wait, you literally meant we're not making
the actual movie <i>Casablanca?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>
<p>That movie already exists.
Why would we make <i>Casablanca?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:10:36</timestamp>
<p>-This is a different movie.
-I think there was a misunderstanding.
</p><timestamp>00:10:40</timestamp>
<p>Wrong, boy-o.
There was a mister-understanding.
</p><timestamp>00:10:43</timestamp>
<p>And that mister is me
understanding you just fine.
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>You come into my home
and you call my work shit?
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>-You know what I think? You're shit.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>You think I don't get enough takes?
I'll get more takes.
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>Just wait, see how many takes I can get.
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>Well, don't go.
We haven't had dessert yet.
</p><timestamp>00:11:03</timestamp>
<p>Shirley's lemon meringue? Mwah.
</p><timestamp>00:11:05</timestamp>
<p>I mean, it's no banana cream pie.
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>Because it's a different kind of pie?
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>slurs</subtitle> That's right.
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p>Why did you have to antagonize him?
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>I wasn't trying to antagonize him.
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>-He said, "It's no <i>Casablanca."</i>
-Well, what's done is done.
</p><timestamp>00:11:23</timestamp>
<p>You're happy.
You didn't want me to go to New York.
</p><timestamp>00:11:25</timestamp>
<p>Lucky me, I get to stay here
and work on this movie
that's gonna ruin my career.
</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p>There's no reason to sulk about it, right?
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>Or you could sulk about it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>Diane does raise some good points.
</p><timestamp>00:11:36</timestamp>
<p>No, she doesn't.
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>Besides, I don't think Diane's the person
you wanna be going to for life advice now.
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>Why? Just because I've been drinking
myself to sleep on your deck chairs
and lying to my husband for the last week?
Hey, there's a Cheez-It on the shelf.
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>I knew I kept these things around
for a reason.
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>-I just had the most amazing prov sesh.
-No one cares, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:11:57</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you guys wanna help me practice?
Make a suggestion.
</p><timestamp>00:12:00</timestamp>
<p>-Stop.
-Aah. Sorry, officer,
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>I didn't see that stop sign.
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:12:06</timestamp>
<p>And my car runs on farts.

</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>-Stop. No, stop it.

</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>Not a suggestion.
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
I just hope I impress the elder council.
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>I want to become a Level Two,
so I can finally achieve clarity
on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>What? No, improv is not a cult.
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>It's just a dogmatic school of thought
taught by a for-profit organization
with the promise of social
and professional opportunities.
</p><timestamp>00:12:35</timestamp>
<p>-Ahh.
-It's a cult. And I know.
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>I learned a little about cults
during that year I was a Scientologist.
</p><timestamp>00:12:42</timestamp>
<p>Coincidentally during that year,
I read a book about cults.
</p><timestamp>00:12:44</timestamp>
<p>Wait, are you saying
Scientology is a cult?
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>No, Scientology is not a cult.
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>Improv is a cult.
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>I wanna be very clear.
This is about improv.
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>-I really don't think it's that bad, guys.
-Why does anything matter, right?
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>Love is an illusion,
and happiness is fleeting,
no such thing as God, and all your
favorite musicians beat their wives.
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p>Allegedly.
</p><timestamp>00:13:07</timestamp>
<p>Would you talk to her?
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:13:09</timestamp>
<p>Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>Heyyy... Hitler.

</p><timestamp>00:13:27</timestamp>
<p>Todd, we take tardiness seriously here
at Shenanigags.
</p><timestamp>00:13:30</timestamp>
<p>-If you miss one more class, you're out.
-I'm sorry. But, wait, Bryan isn't here.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>-He's later than I am.
-Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:13:38</timestamp>
<p>He's been negative, so Copernicus thought
he could benefit from some time away.
</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>He's been reassigned to the Shenanigags
comedy cruise line, the <i>Giggleship.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:13:46</timestamp>
<p>-Is that a reward or a punishment?
-That's up to Bryan.
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>Let's have no more questions
about the <i>Giggleship.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p>Oh, uh, all right.
</p><timestamp>00:13:53</timestamp>
<p>Well, you know,
I was actually talking to my best friend,
and he said improv is a cult.
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>I mean, that's crazy, right?
</p><timestamp>00:14:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>coughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:07</timestamp>
<p>If you think Shenanigags is a cult,
you're free to go, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:14:10</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no. I don't wanna go.
I love this place.
</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p>My friend just doesn't know
how great you guys are.
</p><timestamp>00:14:15</timestamp>
<p>It sounds like your friend's
not yes-and'ing you.
</p><timestamp>00:14:18</timestamp>
<p>Invite him to your graduation show.
</p><timestamp>00:14:20</timestamp>
<p>If he's too negative to support you,
you should take a good hard think
about if that's the kind of energy
you want in your life.
</p><timestamp>00:14:26</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle> I hate good hard thinks.
</p><timestamp>00:14:33</timestamp>
<p>I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter.
But I-- I gotta go.
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>I'm--
Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>The kids get jealous
if I'm talking on the phone.
</p><timestamp>00:14:42</timestamp>
<p>Uh, okay, bye.
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>So, hey, hi.
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>How long are you thinking of staying here?
Just for my own reference.
</p><timestamp>00:14:48</timestamp>
<p>Oh, shit.
Is Wanda making you get rid of me?
</p><timestamp>00:14:51</timestamp>
<p>No one is making me do anything.
</p><timestamp>00:14:53</timestamp>
<p>Except keep acting in this movie you hate.
</p><timestamp>00:14:55</timestamp>
<p>Well, yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:14:56</timestamp>
<p>I really thought I could do it. I thought
I could go far away and help people
and be this best possible version
of myself.
</p><timestamp>00:15:03</timestamp>
<p>And what happened?
</p><timestamp>00:15:04</timestamp>
<p>I couldn't.
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>I wasn't the person I thought I was.
</p><timestamp>00:15:09</timestamp>
<p>I'd love to stay and wallow with you,
but I gotta head out.
</p><timestamp>00:15:11</timestamp>
<p>Today we're filming what used to be the
scene where Secretariat commits suicide,
but is now a scene where he swims
in a fishing hole
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p>-with his girlfriend "Susie Side."
-Yeesh.
</p><timestamp>00:15:21</timestamp>
<p>If you wanna blow off work,
I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,
drink beer, and watch old episodes
of <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

<p>Hey, Diane, you're still here.
And BoJack is here.
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p>Did you go to work today?
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>I was gonna, but then I remembered
everything is garbage,

-Just until the divorce is finalized.

<p>This is a temporary technicality,

</p><timestamp>00:16:32</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.
Okay?
</p><timestamp>00:16:35</timestamp>
<p>Mm. Mm.
</p><timestamp>00:16:36</timestamp>
<p>Hey, your assistant wasn't out there,
so I just-- Ooh.

<p>-Oh, hello.

</p><timestamp>00:16:41</timestamp>
<p>What's going on in here?
</p><timestamp>00:16:42</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.
</p><timestamp>00:16:44</timestamp>
<p>Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency,

<p>BoJack, I wanted to invite you
to my graduation show tomorrow night.
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Look, I know you think
it's just a dumb cult,
but you're my best friend
and it would really mean a lot
if you came.
</p><timestamp>00:17:59</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:18:15</timestamp>
<p>Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy?
A comfy pair of pants?
</p><timestamp>00:18:18</timestamp>
<p>I guess. Why?
</p><timestamp>00:18:20</timestamp>
<p>Just wondering
what kind of hit you're gonna take
when the studio sues the pants off you
for breach of contract.
</p><timestamp>00:18:26</timestamp>
<p>They're suing me?
Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?
</p><timestamp>00:18:29</timestamp>
<p>Because that was a long road to walk

</p><timestamp>00:18:31</timestamp>

<p>Hey, BoJack,
can I talk to you for a minute?
</p><timestamp>00:19:40</timestamp>
<p>Ooh...

<p>Alone, please?

<p>So, good news. We're gonna go on a trip.
</p><timestamp>00:19:49</timestamp>
<p>-Right now. You and me.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:19:50</timestamp>
<p>I booked us a room for the weekend.
Pack your bags, let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:19:53</timestamp>
<p>Where? Why?
</p><timestamp>00:19:54</timestamp>
<p>Less asking, more basking.
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>In the sun, that is. Santa Barbara.
</p><timestamp>00:19:58</timestamp>
<p>-I'm not really in the mood for--

could be really good for us, as a couple.
</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:20:04</timestamp>
<p>I know you've been really bummed out
about the movie,
but I don't think moping around the house
with Diane all day is healthy.
</p><timestamp>00:20:11</timestamp>
<p>All I've ever wanted
was to be in this movie,
and you just want me
to put on a happy face--
</p><timestamp>00:20:15</timestamp>
<p>Yes. There are lots of people
who don't like their jobs.
</p><timestamp>00:20:18</timestamp>
<p>Doesn't mean
they have to bring it home with--
</p><timestamp>00:20:21</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
-What is that supposed to mean?
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>Well, come on.
You're a network executive.
</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>

<p>-watching your former assistant's garbage.
-I don't know where this is coming from.
</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>Every good thing
that ever happened to you happened
because of network executives like me.
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>That show you spend all day watching,
your house, your career--
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>Great house, great career, great life!
Must be why I'm so happy all the time!
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>-You don't know--
-I don't?
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>My life was ruined
by a network executive like you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:08</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm sorry
that things have been so hard for you,
but that doesn't give you the right to be
shitty to me. I can't be around someone
who's just fueled
by bitterness and negativity.
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>Well then, what are you doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>What happened, BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:21:24</timestamp>
<p>Same thing that always happens.
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p>You didn't know me.
Then you fell in love with me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>And now you know me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>You know, it's funny. When you look
at someone through rose-colored glasses,
all the red flags just look like flags.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>-So, Wanda's moving out.
-Oh, shit. Because of me?
</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p>No. Because of me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode
of <i>Horsin' Around?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>Where Olivia does the school project
where she pretends an egg is a baby.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>Spoiler alert:
Ethan needs to make an omelet.
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>Why won't you go home?
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>I should. I know I should.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>I wish I could just go home right now
and crawl into bed
and not have to talk about anything
or explain anything.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>He would just say, "How was your day?"
And then he would say,
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>"Hey, did you know the monorail
was invented by George Monorail?"
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>And I would say,
"I don't think that's true."
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>And he would say, "Well, if he didn't
invent it, he certainly perfected it."
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>And I wouldn't have to say,
"I'm sorry I left.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry I made things so difficult.
</p><timestamp>00:22:30</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry I'm not the person
I thought I was."
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>I would just say, "My day was good."
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>And he would say, "I love you."
</p><timestamp>00:22:41</timestamp>
<p>The longer you keep lying to him,
the harder it's gonna get.
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>
<p>Can I ask you something?
</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>
<p>That play in New York,
would that really have made you happy?
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>And if Kelsey didn't get fired,
and you got to make the movie
you wanted to make,
would that have made you happy?
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>For a little bit.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>But then...
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>Probably...
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>So, what does it matter?
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>But there has to be more.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>Well, when's the last time
you were actually happy?
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>You microchipped my penis? Check, please!
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>

<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:57</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>Hey. How are you?
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>I can't do this anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:24:04</timestamp>
<p>You can't do what anymore?
</p><timestamp>00:24:06</timestamp>
<p>I can't talk to you on the phone
all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:24:09</timestamp>
<p>It's too hard.
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p>Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>I think maybe we should stop
calling each other, for a little bit.
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.
</p><timestamp>00:24:19</timestamp>
<p>But listen, I love you. Okay?
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:24:23</timestamp>
<p>Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:24:26</timestamp>
<p>I love you, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:24:29</timestamp>
<p>-Where is he?
-I don't know, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:24:30</timestamp>
<p>Can't do this to me. Where the hell is he?
