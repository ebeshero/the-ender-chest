<p>Whew.
</p><timestamp>00:00:16</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack?
-I'm back in L.A.
</p><timestamp>00:00:18</timestamp>
<p>-I should have called you--
-Yeah. You should have.
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>-I said I was sorry.
-No, you didn't.
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>-Okay. Good to hear from you, BoJack.
-No--
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>What the...?
</p><timestamp>00:00:37</timestamp>
<p>Okay, thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>What's going on here?
</p><timestamp>00:00:40</timestamp>
<p>Fundraising dinner for the Peanutbutter
for California campaign.
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>-All right, I'm just gonna--
-Sorry. It's a fundraiser.
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-BoJack!
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p>I love your ironic take
on black-tie attire.
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>It really says,
"I truly don't care what you think of me."
</p><timestamp>00:00:54</timestamp>
<p>This light bulb won't let me in
to your house without paying.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>Ah, sorry about that.
Gotta raise those funds.
</p><timestamp>00:00:59</timestamp>
<p>-Can't I just--
-Thanks for your support, buddy.
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>-Means so much. Erica!
-Hey--
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>Look at you,
with the right number of ears!
</p><timestamp>00:01:05</timestamp>
<p>-Look, I just--
-Twenty thousand dollars a plate.

-<subtitle>pops</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>Hey, do you have another bathroom?
They're all occupied, and I gotta pee.
</p><timestamp>00:01:17</timestamp>
<p>Not because I'm pregnant or anything.
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p>Because if I were pregnant, it would be
bad luck to tell you this early.
</p><timestamp>00:01:22</timestamp>
<p>Presuming it was early.
But I'm not pregnant.
</p><timestamp>00:01:23</timestamp>
<p>This is just a normal,
non-pregnant gal type of having to pee.
</p><timestamp>00:01:26</timestamp>
<p>-There's a bathroom in the pool house.
-You're a lifesaver.
</p><timestamp>00:01:29</timestamp>
<p>Pardon me! Out of my way.
</p><timestamp>00:01:30</timestamp>
<p>Uh-oh. Am I in Ithaca?
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>Because you are looking
"gorges" this evening.
</p><timestamp>00:01:34</timestamp>
<p>Well, I must be in Nazi Germany,
because you're "not so" bad yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:01:39</timestamp>
<p>-I'm sorry, yours was better.
-<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Hi.
</p><timestamp>00:01:41</timestamp>
<p>Whoa.
</p><timestamp>00:01:43</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>munches</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:44</timestamp>
<p>Well, I should go.
</p><timestamp>00:01:45</timestamp>
<p>Looks like the work wife/ex-wife
is talking to my other ex-wife.
</p><timestamp>00:01:49</timestamp>
<p>-You have two ex-wives here?
-Katrina's his campaign manager.
</p><timestamp>00:01:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Peanutbutter</subtitle> And Jessica Biel loves
getting photographed at fancy fundraisers.
</p><timestamp>00:01:55</timestamp>
<p>If it isn't my two favorite ladies,
in the same room! This is great.
</p><timestamp>00:02:00</timestamp>
<p>-Hey.
-BoJack, I'm busy.
</p><timestamp>00:02:01</timestamp>
<p>You haven't seen me for a year and a half.
</p><timestamp>00:02:03</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, because you disapp--
No, I am not doing this now.
</p><timestamp>00:02:05</timestamp>
<p>-Why don't you get yourself a drink?
-I will get a drink.
</p><timestamp>00:02:08</timestamp>
<p>I will get $20,000 worth of drinks.

<p>Hi, Zach Braff. Zach Braff.
</p><timestamp>00:02:19</timestamp>
<p>Hey there. Famous actor Zach Braff,
how you doing?
</p><timestamp>00:02:21</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>glass clinks</subtitle>
-Everyone? Thank you all for being here.
</p><timestamp>00:02:24</timestamp>
<p>We're gonna beat that scoundrel
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz...
</p><timestamp>00:02:28</timestamp>
<p>Boo!
</p><timestamp>00:02:29</timestamp>
<p>...and bring likability back to politics.
</p><timestamp>00:02:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>cheering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:33</timestamp>
<p>I especially want to thank my pro-fracking
pals for being here tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>You know, my wife said, "Don't frack,"
but we did it anyway,
and it all worked out.
Love you, sweetie.
</p><timestamp>00:02:43</timestamp>
<p>Mm-hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:02:44</timestamp>
<p>Finally-- oh!
Sorry about that, folks.
</p><timestamp>00:02:46</timestamp>
<p>I sensed an earthquake.
Must have been a false--
</p><timestamp>00:02:48</timestamp>
<p>Oh, hey now!
</p><timestamp>00:02:50</timestamp>
<p>Nope, I was definitely wrong.
</p><timestamp>00:02:51</timestamp>
<p>Listen to me,
I'm the dog who cried earthquake.

-Oh, fudge!
</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-I can't die!
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>I'm not famous enough yet to make
the "In Memoriam" montage at the Oscars!
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p>I have so many regrets!
</p><timestamp>00:03:07</timestamp>
<p>I just picked up a family sitcom
where the mom is a zombie!
</p><timestamp>00:03:10</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>moans</subtitle>
It's called<i> Mombie, </i>and it's terrible!
</p><timestamp>00:03:14</timestamp>
<p>I have a condition where every time
I sense a shift in power dynamics,
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>I have a tiny orgasm!
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>I have no original ideas,
I just repeat things I hear.
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p>-I've never been in love!
-I've never been in love!
</p><timestamp>00:03:24</timestamp>
<p>I tried gay at theater camp!
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>I regret <i>everything!</i>

</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>Hello?
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>Is anyone getting any bars?
I'm not getting any baa-rs.
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Can someone validate my valet ticket?
I would like to go home now.
</p><timestamp>00:04:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}There's no way out.
Okay. Everybody stay sane.
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I propose we set each other on fire
for warmth.
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Who wants to be set on fire first?
Not me, I'm Jessica Biel.
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>woman</subtitle> Yeah, that's right.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The natives are getting restless,
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so why don't you say something
to comfort them?
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Everyone, remain calm!
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>No one's going to light anyone on fire.
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>For one thing,
that'd eat up a lot of oxygen
and who knows
how much we have down here.
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>man</subtitle> I want oxygen!

</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-You okay, sweetie?
-I think so.
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-That was really scary.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}At least we know no one
is specifically at fault.
</p><timestamp>00:05:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, except for San Andreas.
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}This was because you fracked
under our house.
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I told you fracking was dangerous,
and you didn't listen.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And now our house is ruined
and we're trapped underground,
and we're all going to die!
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Is this one of our sexy fights?
-<subtitle>yells</subtitle> No!
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>Hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You can be mad at me or get drunk
with me, but you can't do both.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Watch me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh, what the shit?
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>

<p>-Oh, fish.
-<subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Uh... hello?
</p><timestamp>00:06:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What are you doing in there?
-Uh, I live here.
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>Didn't you know
there was a huge party going on?
</p><timestamp>00:06:10</timestamp>
<p>I was going to go to the party
after my bath,
but then I realized
the bath <i>was </i>the party.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God.
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, I'm not waiting around
to be rescued like some chump.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>Come on, let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Whoa...!
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>-We gotta go in there?
-Well, I don't see any other way.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>Sometimes life is like the second season
of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>--
you gotta push through
and hope there's better stuff ahead.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>Aw-ww!
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>Guys, let's all try to just stay cool
and make the best of things, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>"Make the best of things"? You idiot,
we're trapped and we're terrified.
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>Okay, settle down,
you future hard <i>Jeopardy</i> question.
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p>Let's hear what the idiot has to say.
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p>So that's a re-up on the idiot part?
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p>How are we supposed to make
the best of things?
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>-We're stuck underground.
-This is true.
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>But most of us are important celebrities,
so someone will come for us soon.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>And for you regulars,
I'm sure they'll bring you up with us!
</p><timestamp>00:07:09</timestamp>
<p>What do we do till then?
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>We're actors! I say we put on a show.
Who's with me?
</p><timestamp>00:07:13</timestamp>
<p>A show? Who will be the star?
Me, I assume.
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>Sure you'll be the star,
and you'll be the star!
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>And you'll be the star!
We'll all be the star!
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>Folks, I promise you
we will be out of here in no time.
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>cheering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>And that's when I realized...
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>I just don't have the face for bangs.
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, thank you so much.
You're too kind! Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:36</timestamp>
<p>Thank you, Phoebe, for that rousing
<i>Tale from the Above Ground. </i>Who's next?
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>I can't take this anymore.
I need to get out.
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>This is the longest I've gone
without moisturizing,
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>-and I feel like a lizard!
-Humph.
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>-No offense.
-It's only been 72 hours.
</p><timestamp>00:07:49</timestamp>
<p>I'm missing my general meeting at CBS.
I'm supposed to get baa-ck to work.
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>I can't live like this!
We've gotta light someone on fire.
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>I'm starting to think that less-famous
Michelle Monaghan has the right idea
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>-about lighting people on fire.
-Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:08:00</timestamp>
<p>Come on, party people, keep it together.
Let's not forget why we're here--
to raise money for my campaign,
and more recently, to not go crazy
and murder each other.
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>Can someone please bring me my car?
It's a Prius. A silver Prius.
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>You're killing me, Zach.
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter, you can do this.
</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>Be the leader that I know you can be.
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. You're right. I've totally got this.

<p>We're cool. Just being cool, don't worry.
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>Diane, have you just been getting drunk
with BoJack this whole time?
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>-What? I'm still mad at you.

</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>

but it could be a while.

that's being constructed.
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah!
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>Since a woodchuck is a digging animal,
I came to get you out early.
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>Is that what a woodchuck is?
Why did I think it was like a beaver?
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>What's it like out there, Woodchuck?
Whole neighborhood totaled?
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>-Is the city in chaos?
-No, it's really just your house.
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>Because of all the fracking that's been
happening underneath your house.
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p>Oh! Interesting!
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>-Ay-yi-yi.
-Oh, right, right.
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>So you just burrowed down here to rescue
your political opponent's top donors.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>That's convenient.
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>It was actually very inconvenient,
but I put politics aside
to save you people from dying.
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>Three cheers for Woodchuck!

<p>Please, don't cheer too loudly.

<p>Did you say you're a princess?
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>-That's just my name. I'm a manager.
-It's like an agent.
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>-It's totally different.
-Is it, though?
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>-Silence! You negotiate deals?
-Mm-hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:10:53</timestamp>
<p>You could be of service, Manager Carolyn.

<p>There's no way I can dig us back out now.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>Well, I can dig!
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>Actually, no one should dig.
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>Your foundation is basically Swiss cheese.
</p><timestamp>00:11:12</timestamp>
<p>The slightest provocation could cause
another collapse that would crush us all.

<p>Someone will be coming for us soon.
In the meantime, we must organize.
</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>Parcel out food and water
and see how much we've got.
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>-I'll assign team leaders.

-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>And for you, a radish. Enjoy.
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter, this is a disaster.
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>I don't think so.
I'm food captain, and I am loving it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p>-And who made you the food captain?
-Woodchuck.
</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p>Exactly. He's in charge.
</p><timestamp>00:12:00</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me,
you have not been allocated those rations.
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p>I'm a horse. I need more food,
and I'm a celebrity.
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>-Everyone down here is a celebrity.
-Not the caterers.
</p><timestamp>00:12:10</timestamp>
<p>Relinquish the food.
</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>Hey. Here's your chance.
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>Actually, Woodchuck, this is my house
and BoJack can eat whatever he wants.
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>This man has already reached
his allotted food portion for the day.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>Who said we have to go by your rules?
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, who made you leader
of underground?
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>I'm just gonna take all this and...
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>You've appointed me.
Yes, I under-- citizens, look...

-Uh-oh.
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>Too much sad booze for you.
Where's the happy booze?
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>I'm trapped underground
and it's all my husband's fault
and I'm gonna die in this mansion
in a mass grave with his ex-wives.
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>Okay. But on the bright side--
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>Look, Mr. Peanutbutter loves you,
you got a cool job, you got friends.
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>Jesus, you're right.
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>Even when I was above ground,
I wasn't satisfied.

<p>No. It...
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>I am! I'm a pit.

<p>I'm a pit that good things fall into!
</p><timestamp>00:13:24</timestamp>
<p>Diane, you're not a pit.
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>I'm a pit!

<p>I can't believe I'm crying.
This is so dumb.
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>It's okay.
Don't feel bad about feeling bad.
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>You disappeared for a year and a half.
</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>So you do want to talk about it.
Just took four solid days of drinking.
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>If you were back in L.A.,
why didn't you call me?
</p><timestamp>00:13:48</timestamp>
<p>-I wasn't... ready.
-Ready? For what?
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p>I wanted to be better
when you saw me again.
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>And I thought I could be, somehow.
But I'm not.
</p><timestamp>00:13:58</timestamp>
<p>And even if I did get better,
the best I could ever be
is still just some other version of me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:04</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I can't wait for you to be better.
</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>
<p>I need you in my life.
</p><timestamp>00:14:10</timestamp>
<p>-Really?
-You're the biggest asshole I know,
and you're the only thing
that makes sense to me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:16</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diane sighs, moans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:20</timestamp>
<p>People should be able to have
some control over their lives down here.
</p><timestamp>00:14:24</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah!
-People need boundaries.
</p><timestamp>00:14:25</timestamp>
<p>Leadership means
sometimes being the bad guy.
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p>You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy!
</p><timestamp>00:14:31</timestamp>
<p>I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.
</p><timestamp>00:14:32</timestamp>
<p>-That's not...
-That's a point for Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:14:34</timestamp>
<p>And I'm the good guy,
so that's two points for me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:37</timestamp>
<p>What points? There are no points.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>-This is not a game!
-Well, maybe there should be points.
</p><timestamp>00:14:42</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah!
-Points!
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>People seem to like my points idea.
That's another point for me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm the one who came down here
to save you in the first place.
</p><timestamp>00:14:49</timestamp>
<p>Surely I get points for that.
</p><timestamp>00:14:51</timestamp>
<p>Asking for points is conceited.
That's more points for me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>-He's right!
-What?!
</p><timestamp>00:14:55</timestamp>
<p>If you came down to save us,
why are we still here?
</p><timestamp>00:14:57</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all</subtitle> Yeah!
</p><timestamp>00:14:58</timestamp>
<p>You had one job, and you couldn't do it!
</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah!
-That's right.
</p><timestamp>00:15:01</timestamp>
<p>Minus point for Woodchuck.
</p><timestamp>00:15:02</timestamp>
<p>I implore you not to fall
into a mob mentality.
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>-He called us a mob! Let's kill him!
-Yeah!
</p><timestamp>00:15:08</timestamp>
<p>Folks, Woodchuck's political philosophy
is as broken as his hands.
</p><timestamp>00:15:12</timestamp>
<p>That is a convincing argument.
He does have broken hands.
</p><timestamp>00:15:15</timestamp>
<p>Maybe it's time an outsider took control.
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p>An outsider like me,
the guy whose house this is.

</p><timestamp>00:16:11</timestamp>
<p>But I don't know where to start.
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>
<p>Did she try sending mutual consent form
to the adoption agency?
</p><timestamp>00:16:16</timestamp>
<p>What, what words?
</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>
<p>Well, if it's closed adoption,
you send a mutual consent form.
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>Basically says, "I wanna be open now!"
</p><timestamp>00:16:23</timestamp>
<p>If Mom says same thing,
boom-bah-boo! Smo-pen Sesame!
</p><timestamp>00:16:28</timestamp>
<p>-How do you know about that?
-I had an adopted brother.
</p><timestamp>00:16:31</timestamp>

<p>And for my crimes
I will be fed to its ravenous flames.
</p><timestamp>00:20:23</timestamp>
<p>My only hope is the meat
of Zach Braff proves lasting,
but I fear by daybreak,
there will be no Braff meat left.
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p>-What's going on?
-Four Non-Blondes.
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>Everybody out except the prisoner.
</p><timestamp>00:20:33</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Diane</subtitle> No!
-Easy on the merchandise!
</p><timestamp>00:20:35</timestamp>
<p>Get off me!
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>Well, it's been a tough week,
lots of back and forth,
but I think we've reached an agreement
that meets everybody's needs.
</p><timestamp>00:20:44</timestamp>
<p>"The queen will share
male sex servants with the soldiers
for one night of magnificent,
sensuous splendor,
a gorgeous bacchanal
of hedonistic delights,
with a second orgy pickup option,
pursuant on success of the first."
</p><timestamp>00:20:53</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>hissing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>My clients are satisfied with those terms.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>Great. Now can we please return
to the surface world?
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>All my favorite clouds are up there.
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I like this one.
He's got moxie and a soft thorax.
</p><timestamp>00:21:07</timestamp>
<p>How did you find your fleshy self
in my kingdom, you pink marshmallow?
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>We were at this big
Beverly Hills fundraiser.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>There was an earthquake,
and now everyone's trapped underground.
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>Did you say Beverly Hills?
Ugh! Of course.
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>Surface dwellers are always moving in
on our territory.
</p><timestamp>00:21:23</timestamp>
<p>First they move here, then taxes go up,
the next thing you know,
there's a Whole Foods.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>How am I supposed to concentrate
on a great orgy
when I've got gentrification on my mind?
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>No, we've got to get
those interlopers out of here.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>-Let's--
-Hey! Hold on.
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-<subtitle>Jessica</subtitle> Mr. Peanutbutter,
did you or did you not tell us
we could eat whatever we wanted?
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all</subtitle> Peanutbutter!
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!
Peanutbutter!
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>We gotta do something.
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter's the only non-shitty
thing that's ever happened to me
and now they're gonna set him on fire.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>Okay. What would non-hungover Diane do?
She's smart.
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. I need water.
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>There is no more water.
That's the problem.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>"Choodwuck" is right.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>Wait, isn't there water, under the ground?
Like, a well?
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah! And we're underground.
-If we dig, we'll get water!
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>-Do not dig. The ground is very volatile.
-Quiet, sky rodent! To the shovels!
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter, your time is nigh.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>Any last words
before we light you on fire?
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p>Yes, if I could just say,
"Don't light me on fire"?
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>The fire bends to no man's will.
Nothing can defeat the fire. Only--
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> Water!
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Jessica] What? [gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, wow, it's really water.
-Water is stronger than fire.
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p>Wait, let's not really forget how-- ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>
<p>Water is my new god now!
</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>
<p>Oh, boy.
</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p>-Clear gold!
-All right, water!
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>H-2-Oh, boy, we hit the freaking jackpot!
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p>Hang on. It's-- it's not stopping.
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>Which is great!
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>You hit a pipe, you drunken imbeciles.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>H-2-Oh, no!
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>guests whimpering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>Well, I guess this is it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>bangs</subtitle>
-Oh, God! It's another earthquake!
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all screaming</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>How is this happening?

<p><subtitle>ants</subtitle> Heave! Heave! Heave!
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p>Get them out of here!
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>No! Please! I'm important down here!

<p><subtitle>crashes</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:36</timestamp>
<p>Oh, what an eyesore.
The HOA will be hearing about this.
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p>We are never talking
about any of this ever again. Whew.
</p><timestamp>00:23:48</timestamp>
<p>So I will see you tomorrow.
We've got a rally in Bakersfield
and then we're touring
a tennis ball factory in Modesto.
</p><timestamp>00:23:53</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:23:55</timestamp>
<p>-Hi.
-Hi.
</p><timestamp>00:23:57</timestamp>
<p>You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:59</timestamp>
<p>-I don't tell you that enough.
-It's okay.
</p><timestamp>00:24:01</timestamp>
<p>If this governor thing
is really important to you...
</p><timestamp>00:24:04</timestamp>
<p>It's not. You saw me in there.
I'm a terrible leader.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to be governor.
I just wanted people to like me.
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p>Well, I like you.
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>Come on, Diane, let's go home...
oh, right.
</p><timestamp>00:24:16</timestamp>
<p>Well, thanks for inviting me
to your party.
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>
<p>I had a wonderful time.
Evening really flew by.
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:24:26</timestamp>
<p>-You guys hungry?
-I could eat.
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p>-Ethiopian?
-Ooh, haven't done Ethiopian in a while.
</p><timestamp>00:24:31</timestamp>
<p>I should go home.
I haven't seen my boyfriend in ten days.
</p><timestamp>00:24:34</timestamp>
<p>He's probably worried about me.
</p><timestamp>00:24:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm down for Ethiopian.
I love that sponge bread.
</p><timestamp>00:24:39</timestamp>
<p>-What do they call it, "injera"?
-Yeah, injera.
</p><timestamp>00:24:41</timestamp>
<p>-Injera, right.
-That's right.
</p><timestamp>00:24:45</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, that's good bread.
