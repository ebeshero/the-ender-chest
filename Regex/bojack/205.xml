<p>Son, did you do your homework?
</p><timestamp>00:00:10</timestamp>
<p>I don't wanna do my homework!
</p><timestamp>00:00:12</timestamp>
<p>What, what, what?

<p>Over at Chicken 4 Dayz,
they pump their chickens
full of hormones
and keep them cooped up
in tiny cages.
</p><timestamp>00:00:40</timestamp>
<p>Now, as a chicken, this concerns me.
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p>Here at Gentle Farms,
we treat our livestock differently.
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p>Lush fields, plenty of dignity,
and foosball. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:51</timestamp>
<p>The chickens here
have wonderful lives
before we harvest them,
so you can eat them.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>But wait, Pa, aren't we chickens?
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>I don't wanna get eaten!
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>Boy, these animals aren't like us.
</p><timestamp>00:01:02</timestamp>
<p>They're specifically bred to be eaten,
and genetically modified
for maximum flavor.
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p><i>When our chicks first hatch,</i>
<i>we lovingly inject them</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p><i>with natural delicious hormones,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>which makes them meat,</i>
<i>thereby erasing any moral gray area!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>Now you can feel good
about eating our meat.
</p><timestamp>00:01:20</timestamp>
<p>It's simple:
No one knows chicken like chickens.

</p><timestamp>00:02:59</timestamp>
<p>-This is my daughter, Irving.
-Your daughter's name is Irving?
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Gender-normative names

</p><timestamp>00:03:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Handle her?
-It's Take Your Daughter To Work Day.
</p><timestamp>00:03:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I took my daughter to work,
she got empowered,
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and now I need you
to take my daughter away from work,
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so I can actually do some.
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Mom,
don't pawn me off onto your assistant.
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Can you not fight me on this,
please?
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>Take my car and my daughter,
and go do whatever it is you do.

Down low!
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Nope? Look down.
Just put your eyes down.
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}My hand is below your eye line. No?
</p><timestamp>00:03:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I guess you're stuck with me, kiddo.

<p>What is it, BoJack?
I'm at my dumb niece's wedding.
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>Not you, honey!
A different dumb niece.
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>I feel like Kelsey doesn't like me.
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p><i>You're not really the kind of person</i>

</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>
<p>-Right away?
-Uh, sure.
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>But once they get to know me,
they adore me?
</p><timestamp>00:03:58</timestamp>
<p>How do I put this delicately? No.
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>The problem is we haven't gotten
any one-on-one time.
</p><timestamp>00:04:03</timestamp>
<p>There are always other people around.
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Filming me. Feeding me.

<p>{\an8}Walking me to the garage at night,
because one time I saw a bag
in the wind and I got spooked.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, the only reason
you want Kelsey to like you
is because she's cold and distant.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>Any time someone tries to love you,
you shove them away.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>What? No, I don't, stupid.
You're stupid.
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>Don't be such a dumb stupid idiot, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I gotta go.
Everyone's staring at me for some reason.

<p>{\an8}I call this meeting
of P.B. Livin' to order.
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I believe it was Benjamin Franklin
who said:

<p>"You have reached the end
of your free trial membership

</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What a wise man.
-What's on the agenda, my frienda?
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, here's an idea.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>What if there was a West Dakota?
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>Todd, isn't that a job
for the State Department?
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, I got a whole page
of other ideas,
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}each as impractical
as they are prohibitively expensive.
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You know what they say:
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"You gotta spend money
to make money."
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>So, how can I spend a lot of money?
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>I know. I'll take a spa day.
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>-Uh--
-Eyes, prepare to receive cucumbers.
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p>-We're in a meeting.
-You know what they say:
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>"You gotta skip meetings
to have meetings." See ya.
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>-Wait, what should I do?
-I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>Oh, maybe you could go
on one of your silly Todd adventures.
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn,
I need something to do.
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>A job, or a task,
or a direction in life...
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>You're my agent.
Can you give my life meaning?
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>I don't have time for this.
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>Well, don't stop on my account.
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn,
do I have a purpose?
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p>Oh, purpose? Are you high?
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>Only the normal amount.
</p><timestamp>00:05:46</timestamp>
<p>I gotta go.

</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>

<p>Would you mind

and now, those chickens
have come home to roost.
</p><timestamp>00:10:43</timestamp>
<p>Tom, I want to take full responsibility
for this mishap.
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's why,
for a limited time, everybody,
</p><timestamp>00:10:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}we are offering
our special Full Responsibility Poppers
at participating restaurants
for only $4.99.
</p><timestamp>00:10:56</timestamp>
<p>Tell me, though, if one sees
this delicious escaped chicken
in the street,
should they approach it, or--?
</p><timestamp>00:11:01</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no. I want to be very clear
that this is not like a friend chicken
you see at school or work.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>This is a special kind of food chicken
that has lived its entire life indoors.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>This chicken is not socialized
for the outside world.
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>-Sounds like my ex-wife. Hey-yo!
-<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:17</timestamp>
<p>Oh, Tommy.
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>Look, the safest place
for this chicken right now is with us,
so we can kill it,
turn it into a sludge,
and then press that sludge
into a delicious patty.
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>I'd like to take this moment
to apologize
for the earlier crack
about my ex-wife.
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>Shannon, we shared
14 beautiful years together.
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>How do you respond to allegations
that factory farming
is "torture," or "cruel,"
or "like a terrifying movie
about some strange dystopian society,
but in this monster story,
the horrifying monsters are us"?
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>Relax, Tommy,
everything we do
is completely legal and FDA-approved,
so, therefore, it is fine.
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>I have no follow-up questions.
</p><timestamp>00:12:00</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, Todd, what's your plan?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p>You said you had a plan.
</p><timestamp>00:12:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah. My plan was:
Ask Diane for help.
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>And now my plan has been completed.
</p><timestamp>00:12:10</timestamp>
<p>Nice follow-through, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>We have a 'roided out chicken

</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>Hey, geniuses,

</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>Yeah,

bumper sticker?
</p><timestamp>00:13:00</timestamp>
<p>As relevant today as it was then.
</p><timestamp>00:13:02</timestamp>
<p>Are you aware said Volvo
is currently harboring a fugitive chicken,
along with a teenage girl,
a small, sprite-like man,
and a maid of some sort?
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>That's my daughter!
Not the maid. The other one.
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>I'd wager they're making a run
for Gentle Farms.
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>Don't worry, though.
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>We'll bring your daughter home,

<p>-Alive! Alive!

<p>All right, troops, listen up!

<p>You're a loose cannon,

</p><timestamp>00:13:36</timestamp>
<p>No, I'm not. I'm a cannon, maybe,
but a loose cannon?
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>Is that what you think of me?
</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>
<p>I think you play
by your own rules.
</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>No way,

</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>These are all attributes
of a loose cannon.
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>No, I'm just a reckless renegade.
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>-Sergeant Stone's a loose cannon.
-Aah!
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>You shut your trap, Fuzzyface.
</p><timestamp>00:13:54</timestamp>
<p>I'd say Stone's more of a cop on the edge
with nothing to lose.
</p><timestamp>00:13:57</timestamp>
<p>-That's a different thing.
-Now I'm just confused.
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>Is Meow Meow Fuzzyface
a loose cannon or not?

<p>Uh-oh, <i>siesta</i> time.

<p>I need to go. Irving ran off
with a fugitive chicken in my car.
</p><timestamp>00:14:19</timestamp>
<p>We can take my car.
This is perfect.
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>Why is this perfect?
My daughter could be in danger.
</p><timestamp>00:14:23</timestamp>
<p>Yes, I agree, but we can use the car ride
to get some one-on-one.
</p><timestamp>00:14:27</timestamp>
<p>I mean, who is BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:14:29</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure I can find another ride.
</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p>Every second you waste
finding another ride,
your daughter gets closer to getting
her eyes poked out by a mutant chicken,
or worse, death,
or slightly better, teen pregnancy,
or worse again, salmonella.
</p><timestamp>00:14:41</timestamp>
<p>Okay, fine. Let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>Yay! I'm calling this road trip the 007,

</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>

<p>Now you can just be a chicken.
</p><timestamp>00:15:37</timestamp>
<p>See, this is where you belong, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:15:39</timestamp>
<p>You hear me?
I don't want you no more.
</p><timestamp>00:15:41</timestamp>
<p>You weren't the best friend I ever had,

</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>I don't understand
why you need me to like you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:10</timestamp>
<p>I don't need you to like me.
It would be fun if you liked me,
because I'd prove my parents were wrong
to never support me,
because I earned the admiration
of an authority figure,
proving I have intrinsic worth,
but it's not a big deal or anything.
Jeez.

<p>-No. We gotta get her back.

</p><timestamp>00:17:09</timestamp>
<p>He wasn't doing that

<p>Oh, I found her! Diane!
This one's Becca!
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>No! Todd! Don't you get it?
</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>-They're all Becca.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:21:09</timestamp>
<p>Okay, go, chickens!
You're free.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>Go, run to freedom!
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>For generations
they will tell your story!

<p><subtitle>Levi</subtitle> Only we know how to care
for these creatures, you hear?
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>

<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p>-Diane, I'm sorry I got you into this.
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle> It's not your fault.
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>I don't know why
I always get into these messes.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>You know,
sometimes I feel like my whole life
is just a series
of loosely-related wacky misadventures.
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>I think that's just
what being in your 20s is.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>-Really?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>
<p>I'm supposed to be the adult here,
and I'm a total mess.
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>You kidding?
You're the coolest person I know.
</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p>-Really?
-Yeah. You always know what to do,
and you don't take shit from anyone.
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>Is that how you see me?
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>Of course. You're like Lara Croft.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:22:23</timestamp>
<p>Please. Take me with you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>I hate it here.
I don't want to kill chickens.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>I want to design video games
that help kids learn math.
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>I am so sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>Okay, that was crazy! Just go.
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>Let's get out of here!

<p>Oh, my God, Irving,
thank God you're safe.
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>Mom, I'm fine.
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p>Stop embarrassing me
in front of my cool friends.
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p>What? Cool?
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>I mean,
that's cool that you think I'm cool.
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>I don't care or anything,
but, you know, it's cool.
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>Hey, this guy.
What'd you get arrested for?
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>-Being too cute?

-Listen up, everybody.
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>
<p>I, famous celebrity BoJack Horseman,
have an announcement.
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>I'm going to ask you to drop all charges
on account of me being a celebrity.
</p><timestamp>00:23:36</timestamp>
<p>We gracefully accept
the requisite slap on the wrist
and a brief,
but ultimately pointless, trial
in the court of public opinion.
Good day.
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p>Well, you are famous,
so you are all free to go.
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Stone yells</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:48</timestamp>
<p>-But what about Becca?
-Took care of that, too.
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>Called in a favor with Drew Barrymore,
and she'll pay off Chicken 4 Dayz
to adopt your friend.
</p><timestamp>00:23:55</timestamp>
<p>Does she have a meadow
that Becca can frolic around in?
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>You think Drew Barrymore
doesn't have a frolicking meadow?
</p><timestamp>00:24:01</timestamp>
<p>That is the dumbest thing I've heard.
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>I learned something today.
</p><timestamp>00:24:04</timestamp>
<p>When you think
something isn't about you,
you find a way to save the day
and realize that it was,
all along, all about you.
</p><timestamp>00:24:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:13</timestamp>
<p>Plus, I got you all a burrito truck!
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>-Hooray!
-Yay! I'm great!
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>So, after all that,
the only thing that saved Becca
was that BoJack was friends
with Drew Barrymore?
</p><timestamp>00:24:26</timestamp>
<p>-Yep.
-So, did anything we did matter?
</p><timestamp>00:24:29</timestamp>
<p>-Nope.
-I think it did.
</p><timestamp>00:24:31</timestamp>
<p>I think we made a difference.
</p><timestamp>00:24:33</timestamp>
<p>A small one, but a difference.
</p><timestamp>00:24:35</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I think we did, too.
</p><timestamp>00:24:37</timestamp>
<p>I think we really changed things
for the better.
