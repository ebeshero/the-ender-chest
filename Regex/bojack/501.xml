<p>Come on, guys. Pay attention.
The squib didn't fire.
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>-What did I do?
-Not you. Squib. Squib.
</p><timestamp>00:00:51</timestamp>
<p>-The squib.
-I don't need any help. Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>-You're doing great, BoJack.
-Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>And I did a great job watching you,
which is most of what producing is.
</p><timestamp>00:00:59</timestamp>
<p>We're doing it, buddy! First day!
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>Listen, I still have some questions
about my character,
and the script, and the show,
and you asking me to do this show,
</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p>-and me saying, "Yes".
-Hey, can we get rid of Philbert's watch?
</p><timestamp>00:01:10</timestamp>
<p>The network doesn't want us
to remind the audience
about the existence of clocks.
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p>And why we're making a TV show
for What-Time-Is-It-Right-Now-dot-com,
which is a website for people
who don't know their computers
already have built-in clocks
at the corner of the screen?
</p><timestamp>00:01:23</timestamp>
<p>All your questions will be answered.
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p>But in the meantime,
would it kill you to smile?

</p><timestamp>00:02:43</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Flip. Can I ask why I'm calling
her a bitch twice?
</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>The first bitch is her.
The second bitch is your heart.
</p><timestamp>00:02:48</timestamp>
<p>Okay, you know, I have some questions
about my character.

-Okay, well, my first question is--
</p><timestamp>00:02:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-BoJack Horseman...
-Oh, jeez. Here we go.
</p><timestamp>00:03:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}...and Mr. Peanutbutter
on the same studio backlot?
</p><timestamp>00:03:04</timestamp>
<p>-One sec--
-What is this?
</p><timestamp>00:03:05</timestamp>
<p>-A mismatched buddy comedy...
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:03:07</timestamp>
<p>...about two guys
from different sides of the tracks
who learn to respect each other
because they have a common interest?
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>-Who's this guy?
-Ignore him. Why--
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>And a grudging respect
blossoms into real friendship
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}as they set aside their differences
to achieve a shared goal...
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Stop it.
-...each bringing their own strength
to the table,
and possibly there's a karaoke scene?
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>Why does John Philbert's house
look the same as my house?
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>I've never been to your house.
</p><timestamp>00:03:30</timestamp>
<p>The set was designed to reflect
Detective Philbert.
</p><timestamp>00:03:34</timestamp>
<p>Spare, lonely, precariously balanced
on a hill of his own isolation.
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>It kind of looks
like David Boreanaz's house.
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The set designer
actually took a tour there.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, that's very interesting.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>Why are you here?
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>I'm playing Julius Caesar
on the stage next door, in a movie!
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>Well, it's a short film.
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>-I gotta run.
-Wait!
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>I'll see you next time
I'm <i>Roman</i> around the lot!
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Flip, when can we talk?
-Tomorrow morning.
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Hi.

-Wow.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sorry, I can't do you.
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm too distracted, I'd just do a bad job.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You know your own body better than me
anyway so just go to town.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yeah, I'm gonna go.
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Wait, Gina.
Can I ask you a question, about you?
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Uh-huh?
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Do you think I'm right, and
the Philbert character is poorly written,
and Flip needs to write him better,
so I don't look so bad?
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>Look, I do one of these shows every year.
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>And I keep getting hired
because I show up, do the work,
and keep my head down.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>But do you love this script?
Do you love your character?
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Do I love Internal Affairs Director
Sassy Malone,
</p><timestamp>00:04:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}whose primary character traits
are that she hates bras
</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and loves cold rooms?
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Not especially.
It feels gratuitous and male-gazey.
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But it pays for my expensive habit
of having a mortgage
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-in Southern California.
-You don't have to go.
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>We could hang out.
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure you don't wanna be all alone
in a house by yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No, I love being alone.
I wish I were alone right now.

<p>I could ask you the same question.
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>Now you're in college
you don't need to sleep anymore?
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p><i>No, I was sleeping.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>You called me and woke me up.
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>Oh, right.
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>I wanted you to know
that I hearted your Instagram photo.
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>Okay, cool.
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>Well, there were 23 other hearts.
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p>But I don't know if you know
who they're all from, but one was from me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, they let me know.
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh, cool, cool.
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I'm going back to sleep.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>Fine, but this phone call does not replace
our weekly Sunday call. Okay?
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I'll talk to you Sunday afternoon.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>Yes. Good. Because I miss you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, that sounded dumb.
I don't miss you, I'm just bored.
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>

<p>Good morning, lovebugs!
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>Don't mind me, just passing through!
Not sneaking a peek at the lovebugs!
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>There's nothing to see
that would embarrass any of us.
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>-We are all fully clothed.
-Ha-ha. If you say so!
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p>What are you gonna do
while I'm at work all day?
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>There's an old frog
who lives down in the L.A. River.
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>He owes me an egg salad sandwich,
on account of a caper we once went on.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-I was gonna see if he wants
to make instruments out of shoeboxes
and rubber bands.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>And, uh, that will satisfy you?
</p><timestamp>00:06:39</timestamp>
<p>When your life is ends,
and you're looking back at this day,
you'll think that was a good day?
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>Well, from your preliminary paperwork
you seem like a perfect candidate.
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p>Thanks, I just never thought
it would be like this.
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>I mean, my mom popped out kids
by the dozen. And I can't even--
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>Mnh-mnh. Princess Carolyn,
is your name Cutie Cutie Cupcake?
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>-No, that's--
-Were you born on August 12th, 1947?
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>-I--
-Do you sleep with your hands stuffed
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>-in lotion-filled socks?
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>Right, because you are not your mother.
</p><timestamp>00:07:11</timestamp>
<p>-How did you know--
-What you are is noble,
honorable, and unimpeachable.
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>Anyone can just have a baby.
But to adopt one? That takes a hero.
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>It takes a selfless, giving,
kickass superwoman
who's willing to take out
her checkbook right now
and write the adoption agency
a check for $60,000.
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>Well. <subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>Fabulous.
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>I'm just so glad
that I'm on this journey with you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn,
I'm with you every step of the way,
from you giving me this check
all the way to me introducing you
to your new caseworker, Tracy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>-Hey.
-Ah!
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>You're in wonderful hands, bye!
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>Uh, what--
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>Congratulations. What are you,
like, five months pregnant?
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>No, I'm not a birth mother. I'm adopting.
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that makes sense.
'Cause you're so old.
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>Is Mikhaela ever coming back?

<p>-<subtitle>scoffs</subtitle> Yeah, in your dreams.

</p><timestamp>00:08:03</timestamp>
<p>Yes. Yes. No. Yes. What?!
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>Jeanine, the script
calls for hot and haunted.
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>Does this girl look hot
and haunted to you?
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I'm sure she was hot
for <i>Shakespeare in the Park,</i>
but I need TV hot.
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>-Actually, she's starting to look haunted.
-<subtitle>door opens</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>-Hey! Uh, this a bad time?
-It's fine.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>I can talk to you and also judge
these women's bodies at the same time.
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>What do you want?
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, first of all,
the script is great.
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>Really top-notch stuff.
I love the whole... thing of it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>I just wanted to clarify some things
about Philbert as a character.
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>Mm-hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, okay, on page three,
is it necessary that Philbert
can only orgasm if he's listening
</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>
<p>-to a recording of his dead wife's voice?
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, what about this thing
on page eight
where he goes to a strip club and just
sits in the back with a sketch-pad
and draws the strippers,
while a Leonard Cohen song plays?
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>What about it?
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>It's just that
all of these half-naked women.
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I understand it.
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm just worried it might come across
as gratuitous and, uh, male-gazey,
which I know it isn't!
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>Hmm. You know what? You girls can go home.
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>The stripper scene's cut.
</p><timestamp>00:09:12</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-Seriously?
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>-Uh, oh. Uh...
-How am I gonna feed my baby?
</p><timestamp>00:09:15</timestamp>
<p>I just got an idea for something better.
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>So, instead of drawing strippers naked,
you're just going to draw Gina naked.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>Gina, BoJack was concerned the old scene
was gratuitous and male-gazey.
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>Oh, he was? BoJack said that?
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Flip</subtitle> This is much more interesting
and motivated by character.
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>And since it's motivated by character,
that means it's not gratuitous.
</p><timestamp>00:09:38</timestamp>
<p>Thank you for the note, BoJack,
you really helped.
</p><timestamp>00:09:41</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Thanks, BoJack, for helping.
</p><timestamp>00:09:43</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, um...
-<subtitle>Flip</subtitle> Can we get some ice?
</p><timestamp>00:09:45</timestamp>
<p>Can we get some nipple ice for Gina?
</p><timestamp>00:09:51</timestamp>
<p>-So, you're the famous Yolanda.
-I am not famous.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>You might have me confused
with another more famous Yolanda.
</p><timestamp>00:09:56</timestamp>
<p>I know, I-I just meant
because Todd talks about you so much,
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>I feel like you're famous.
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>Oh, well, that was not clear.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Todd, why don't you say things now?
</p><timestamp>00:10:05</timestamp>
<p>Steve, you still fixing up your truck?
</p><timestamp>00:10:07</timestamp>
<p>You're thinking of Emily's old boyfriend,
firefighter Steve D'Marco.
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I'm firefighter Steve D'Mazio.
We're very different.
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>But I do have a truck,
and I'm fixing it up.
</p><timestamp>00:10:16</timestamp>
<p>So, thanks for asking.
</p><timestamp>00:10:17</timestamp>
<p>I created a dating app
for firefighters to meet me.
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>-Looks like it worked.
-<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:10:22</timestamp>
<p>Hey! We should create a dating app
for asexuals.
</p><timestamp>00:10:26</timestamp>
<p>Why would asexuals want a dating app?
</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>
<p>Well, not all asexuals are aromantic.
</p><timestamp>00:10:31</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-Think of it this way.
</p><timestamp>00:10:33</timestamp>
<p>One could be: A, Romantic,
or B, Aromantic,
while also being A, Sexual, or B, Asexual.
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>So you could be BB, or BA.
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>As for me, see AB, see?
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>So, even within the one percent
of the population that's asexual,
there's an even smaller percentage
that is still looking
for romantic companionship.
</p><timestamp>00:10:56</timestamp>
<p>Seems like a pretty thin user base
for an app.
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>But without it, asexual romantics
might end up settling for just whatever
other asexual romantics they might meet,
even if they have nothing else in common.
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>-Well, anyway--
-Yeah, but maybe it's good
if they have nothing in common
because then they can help each other grow
and change, and become fuller,
more well-rounded people.
</p><timestamp>00:11:17</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, that's true.
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>So, Todd, are you still doing
that rabid clown-dentist exercise thing?
</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no, that whole thing kinda fell apart
when the clowns got loose.
</p><timestamp>00:11:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>mystery music</subtitle>

<p>Well, how about I show you?

<p>-<subtitle>Mr. Peanutbutter</subtitle> Wow!
-<subtitle>Flip</subtitle> Cut!
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>Someone keeps shouting "Wow" and "Ooh."
</p><timestamp>00:11:50</timestamp>
<p>You guys are doing a bang-up job
over here.
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>So sayeth Caesar! King of the apes!
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>Look, man, I know what you're doing, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:11:57</timestamp>
<p>You're trying to punish me.
Just don't punish Gina.
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>I'm not trying to punish anyone.
</p><timestamp>00:12:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm just trying to make a good show
that's brilliant and unprecedented.
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>It sounds like you guys
are basically on the same page.
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>You're the only one with a problem here.
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>-Gina is fine with it.
-Gina is not fine with it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>You guys, you're almost saying
exactly the same thing.
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>Except one of you is saying "not".
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>Gina, do you have a problem
with the nudity in this scene?
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>It's great. It's brilliant, unprecedented.
I'm gonna get some potatoes.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>You see? Everyone's fine with it but you.
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>So, can we drop it?
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>I know you're used to being
the most important person on set.
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>-This is not about me.
-It's weird for you
that I don't need to listen.
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>-I'm not--
-Hey, hey--
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>But if you actually have notes
that are helpful,
</p><timestamp>00:12:35</timestamp>
<p>I would love to hear them when
you're done swinging your dick around.
</p><timestamp>00:12:38</timestamp>
<p>-No, this is not about my dick.
-Okay, fellas...
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>-Well, maybe it should be about your dick.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:12:44</timestamp>
<p>Since you're so concerned
about the male gaze,
let's give the females
something to gaze at.
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>We'll do a full-frontal nude scene
with you.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>This is compromise!
This is working together.
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p>-Well, hold on.
-Fully exposed, Philbert reaches up
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p>-with both hands to screw in a light bulb.
-Yes!
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>He totters in little circles
on a tiny stool.
</p><timestamp>00:13:03</timestamp>
<p>-Wouldn't I just turn my wrist?
-Full body rotation. We see everything.
</p><timestamp>00:13:07</timestamp>
<p>Now we're talking!
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>
<p>-No, we're not! Princess--
-I'm on it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>Flip, BoJack can only do this scene
</p><timestamp>00:13:12</timestamp>
<p>-if he can wear a T-shirt.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>He's very self-conscious
about his belly area.
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>No, I'm self-conscious
about my penis area.
</p><timestamp>00:13:19</timestamp>
<p>He can't wear a shirt.
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>It's about being vulnerable.
</p><timestamp>00:13:22</timestamp>
<p>We see every fold and imperfection
of his wrinkled, saggy body.
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>-Hey!
-So we like him.
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>But he has to be fully erect
so we respect him.
</p><timestamp>00:13:30</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-We'll shoot it tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah.
-Unless you don't like this idea,
in which case, we can go back
to what we were doing.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>-Right.
-Well--
</p><timestamp>00:13:36</timestamp>
<p>So, you would be admitting
that you don't actually care
about the male gaze
and you were only giving me notes
to hear yourself talk.
</p><timestamp>00:13:43</timestamp>
<p>But that's not it, right?
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>-Right.
-Great.
</p><timestamp>00:13:46</timestamp>
<p>-Shooting is tomorrow afternoon.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>-I'll send the waxing kit over tonight.
-Philbert waxes?
</p><timestamp>00:13:50</timestamp>
<p>Not for cosmetic purposes.
He just wants to feel something.
</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
-Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:13:58</timestamp>
<p>I like your friend.
It's impressive how she creates companies.
</p><timestamp>00:14:01</timestamp>
<p>And her boyfriend has
an interesting career as well.
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>Yeah! And you have an interesting career.
</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p>Hey! The three of you
all have interesting careers.
</p><timestamp>00:14:09</timestamp>
<p>That is so cool!
</p><timestamp>00:14:11</timestamp>
<p>Todd, do you ever feel weird
that you have
no discernible life direction?
</p><timestamp>00:14:15</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-Let me rephrase that.
</p><timestamp>00:14:16</timestamp>
<p>I feel weird that you have
no discernible life direction.
</p><timestamp>00:14:19</timestamp>
<p>-Oh.
-I mean...
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>-What am I supposed to tell people?
-A story? A joke?
</p><timestamp>00:14:25</timestamp>
<p>Compliments are things
people like being told sometimes.
</p><timestamp>00:14:29</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. How was your day?
Did you end up meeting with that frog?
</p><timestamp>00:14:33</timestamp>
<p>No, I just stayed home
and looked at stuff on the Internet.
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:14:41</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
-Hello, Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>You're not Princess Carolyn.
Why are you not Princess Carolyn?
</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>-She gets home pretty late.
-I came all this way for nothing?
</p><timestamp>00:14:49</timestamp>
<p>I brought my spinny chair
and everything!
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>
<p>Well, if you want something to do,
you could help me find a job.
</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>-You're looking for a job?
-I spent all day looking!
</p><timestamp>00:14:56</timestamp>
<p>First, I thought
I should get a newspaper to find one,
but then I was, like,
"Where do I find a newspaper?"
</p><timestamp>00:15:01</timestamp>
<p>-Uh.
-So, I looked it up.
</p><timestamp>00:15:02</timestamp>
<p>And a map came up of my local area.
</p><timestamp>00:15:04</timestamp>
<p>So, then I thought about
how I know this area pretty well,
but there's all kinds of areas
I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:15:09</timestamp>
<p>-Like South Africa.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:15:11</timestamp>
<p>-And then I thought about Charlize Theron.
-Uh, right.
</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>
<p>And then I thought about
that movie <i>Monster.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:15:16</timestamp>
<p>And then I was, like,
"What year did that come out?"
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p>-So I went to Monster.com...
-<subtitle>pc clacking</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:20</timestamp>
<p>...to look up facts
about the movie <i>Monster,</i>
and it turns out
they have job postings there!
</p><timestamp>00:15:25</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Bojack sups</subtitle>
-What a time to be alive!
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>Hey! A posting for
WhatTimeIsItRightNow.com!
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Oh, a janitor job.
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>I've always wanted to... Janet!
</p><timestamp>00:15:35</timestamp>
<p>I just got an amazing idea.
Interview for that job!
</p><timestamp>00:15:37</timestamp>
<p>Uh... Was that your amazing idea?
</p><timestamp>00:15:40</timestamp>
<p>Because I feel, like,
it kinda came out of the room.
</p><timestamp>00:15:42</timestamp>
<p>When you get in the building,
say you need to use the WC.
</p><timestamp>00:15:44</timestamp>
<p>Then you'll sneak into the office
of one of the network execs.
</p><timestamp>00:15:47</timestamp>
<p>Go into their email
and send a message to Flip McVicker
telling him he can't film
any more nude scenes
because they're derivative
and unnecessary,
</p><timestamp>00:15:54</timestamp>
<p>-especially the nude scenes involving me.
-You are throwing a lotta words at me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:58</timestamp>
<p>Todd, don't you get it?
We're gonna save the show!
</p><timestamp>00:16:02</timestamp>
<p>You're on a show?
</p><timestamp>00:16:06</timestamp>
<p>This is a very impressive resume.
</p><timestamp>00:16:08</timestamp>
<p>Yep. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must adjourn to the restroom.
</p><timestamp>00:16:12</timestamp>
<p>You founded a ride-share app.
You built and managed your own theme park.
</p><timestamp>00:16:16</timestamp>
<p>And you were, briefly,
Governor of California!
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>I was also the director
of a <i>Star Wars</i> movie,
but they fired me
over "creative differences."
</p><timestamp>00:16:24</timestamp>
<p>Now about that restroom...
</p><timestamp>00:16:26</timestamp>
<p>Hold on. You are way overqualified
to be a janitor.
</p><timestamp>00:16:28</timestamp>
<p>-Okay. But I do actually need to go.
-Oh, you need to go, all right.
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p>-Straight to the top of this company!
-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>
<p>We're ready for you on set, Mr. Horseman.

<p>Why not? You're their boss now.
You can tell them what to do.
</p><timestamp>00:17:02</timestamp>
<p>I could, but I'm no leader at all

<p>Ugh, Todd, your good-hearted naiveté
has once again conspired
with outrageous happenstance
to completely dick me over!
</p><timestamp>00:17:19</timestamp>
<p>Have you tried just talking
to the show runner?
</p><timestamp>00:17:21</timestamp>
<p>In my experience,
I've found it's best to shoot straight,
in the boardroom and on the driving range.

people talk, you know what I mean?
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>-I never do!
-<subtitle>cell phone beeps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, Flip, we need to talk.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:17:39</timestamp>
<p>-I'm not doing the naked scene.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:17:40</timestamp>
<p>The only reason you wrote it
is to embarrass me.
</p><timestamp>00:17:43</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I'm not writing scenes
for my television show
and also directing them
in order to teach you lessons
or send you secret messages.
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>I'm just trying to make a good show.
</p><timestamp>00:17:53</timestamp>
<p>-Why do you keep making it so difficult?
-I'm making it difficult?
</p><timestamp>00:17:56</timestamp>
<p>I have done nothing,
but be a friend to you.
</p><timestamp>00:17:59</timestamp>
<p>I actually called my mom last night
and told her that I made a friend on set.
</p><timestamp>00:18:03</timestamp>
<p>Do you wanna make me a liar to my mother?
</p><timestamp>00:18:06</timestamp>
<p>-What? Ew. Weird.
-Take off that robe and go to set.
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-Take off that robe right now.
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p>Why can't you act like a professional
and get naked?
</p><timestamp>00:18:15</timestamp>
<p>Because it's dumb!
This whole show is duuuuuuumb!
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:18:20</timestamp>
<p>It's confusing, it's overwritten,
and it's poorly lit.
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p>The darkness is a metaphor for darkness!
</p><timestamp>00:18:26</timestamp>
<p>And worst of all, it's boring!
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>
<p>It has nothing to say,
and it says that nothing badly!
</p><timestamp>00:18:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>inhales</subtitle> Let me tell you
how this is going to be.
</p><timestamp>00:18:35</timestamp>
<p>I am the show creator
and if I want your character to get naked,
he gets naked.
</p><timestamp>00:18:40</timestamp>
<p>If I want him to speak only in Korean,
you're learning Korean.
</p><timestamp>00:18:44</timestamp>
<p>If I want your character to shit his pants
and walk around with shit in his pants
for the rest of the season,
</p><timestamp>00:18:49</timestamp>
<p>-you will do just that.
-<subtitle>mystery music</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, come on.
-You signed a contract.
</p><timestamp>00:18:53</timestamp>
<p>And that means I am your god.
</p><timestamp>00:18:55</timestamp>
<p>You will please your god,
and if I don't see your ass on set
then I will see your ass in court.
</p><timestamp>00:19:02</timestamp>
<p>Do you understand?
</p><timestamp>00:19:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:05</timestamp>
<p>That's a good note about the lighting.
I'll take a look at that.
</p><timestamp>00:19:10</timestamp>
<p>Good news! We found a birth mother!
</p><timestamp>00:19:13</timestamp>
<p>Really? A-already?
</p><timestamp>00:19:14</timestamp>
<p>She came in yesterday.
</p><timestamp>00:19:16</timestamp>
<p>She's giving her baby
to a sweet couple in Illinois.
</p><timestamp>00:19:18</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:19:20</timestamp>
<p>Did you think we found
a birth mother for you?
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p>Conceited much?
</p><timestamp>00:19:24</timestamp>
<p>Tracy, I’m spending a lot of money
to be here with you
and I'm putting myself
in a very vulnerable position.
</p><timestamp>00:19:29</timestamp>
<p>Is there any way
you can be a little more thoughtful
with the way you manage me as a client?
</p><timestamp>00:19:34</timestamp>
<p>It sounds like what you're looking for
is an adoption manager.
</p><timestamp>00:19:37</timestamp>
<p>This is an adoption agency.
</p><timestamp>00:19:39</timestamp>
<p>-Do you not know the difference?

<p>BoJack and I got into a fight.
</p><timestamp>00:19:46</timestamp>
<p>-And he never showed up on set.

<p>-<subtitle>horn blaring</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:19:50</timestamp>

<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack.
-Hold on, I got a thing with a chair.
</p><timestamp>00:19:59</timestamp>
<p>How did you even find me?
</p><timestamp>00:20:01</timestamp>
<p>Duh. Bought a burner phone,
slipped it into your purse,
and then used the Find My Phone app.
</p><timestamp>00:20:05</timestamp>
<p>How thoughtful.
</p><timestamp>00:20:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>deep voice</subtitle> Hello, Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:20:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God.
</p><timestamp>00:20:09</timestamp>
<p>I have a plan and I need your help.
</p><timestamp>00:20:11</timestamp>
<p>-I found out his mom has a fake leg.
-Who's mom?
</p><timestamp>00:20:13</timestamp>
<p>Flip. I'm gonna seduce her, steal her leg,
and then smack him across the face with it
until he chokes on his own blood.
</p><timestamp>00:20:20</timestamp>
<p>It's subtle,
but I think he'll get the message.
</p><timestamp>00:20:23</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, what are you trying
to accomplish here?
</p><timestamp>00:20:25</timestamp>
<p>I-I don't want to do the show.
</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>
<p>So you're gonna run away
like you always do?
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I never wanted to do this show!
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p>-You faked my signature!
-And I told you that,
and you said, "Okay" because you wanted
to be a good friend to me!
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>So, you can't get points for that
and then resent me for it now.
</p><timestamp>00:20:39</timestamp>
<p>-It's not about you! I don't like him!
-Oh, Flip's not that bad.
</p><timestamp>00:20:42</timestamp>
<p>He's just insecure
and is overcompensating a little.
</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>I know that must be
a foreign concept for you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>No, not Flip. Philbert.
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>He-he's a drunk.
He's an asshole. I don't want to be him.
</p><timestamp>00:20:53</timestamp>
<p>So, maybe don't be the drunk asshole.
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>Maybe this time, you have a good attitude
and you don't drink so much
and you show up at your call time.
</p><timestamp>00:21:01</timestamp>
<p>And then you put on the Philbert costume
and you <i>pretend </i>to be this other guy.
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>And then when you're done shooting,
you take off your costume
and you're BoJack, the star of the show
that everybody likes.
</p><timestamp>00:21:13</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>Hey, why are we at an adoption agency?
Are you adopting something?
</p><timestamp>00:21:18</timestamp>
<p>-I'm trying to.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>So, can you keep it together
for the next ten weeks
so I don't need to come to set,
every day, to put out fires?
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p>You think you could do that? For me?

<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> Hey, stranger.
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>It sounds like you had an amazing trip.
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>I did. What have you been up to?
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>Well, I did play Julius Caesar
in a pizza commercial
that they're going to... <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
...get this, show in movie theaters.
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>Wow, look at you. Pizza.
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p><i>Et Cru-Dités?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-That was my line.
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>
<p>I played Little Caesar's dad, Big Caesar,
in the back story part of the commercial,
which is funny because most commercials
don't even have a back story part.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>Also, Little Caesar's
doesn't sell crudités.
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>Oh, man, my part's definitely going
to get cut, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>Just like the real Caesar!
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>Hey, that's right!
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>-Well, here's your place.
-<subtitle>horns honking</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>Yep. Here it is.
</p><timestamp>00:22:23</timestamp>
<p>Well, anyway, I signed the papers.
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Great!
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, so if it all looks good to you
and your lawyer,
you can sign it too
and then it'll be official.
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>Divorce completed.
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>-Yay.
-We did it.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>Take that, our marriage!
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>-Well, I guess I'll see you around?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>-I was going to--
-Sorry.

<p>-<subtitle>both laughing</subtitle>
-Sorry. Just go all the way.
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>

<p>-<subtitle>buzzes</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>What's that for? We've all seen me naked.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>Can't put the genie
back in the bottle now, baby.
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>crew laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>Thanks anyway, Judy.
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>This is great. Any other work environment
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and this would be considered
sexual harassment.
</p><timestamp>00:23:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-<subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
-Ooh, Cadbury Creme Eggs.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yes, please!
Whoops. Gonna need new yogurt.

<p>So, then Aaron Eckhart
said, "If that's Ansel Elgort,
then who's Alden Ehrenreich?"
</p><timestamp>00:23:30</timestamp>
<p>-And then I said, <i>''Gesundheit''</i>
-<subtitle>all laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>-Flip! You made it.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:36</timestamp>
<p>Jesus Christ, your house really does look
like Philbert's.
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>That's what I've been trying to tell you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>Thanks for being so cool today
about the naked stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:23:46</timestamp>
<p>Those chicks always make
such a big deal about their bodies.
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>Maybe now that you've done it,
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>Gina won't complain so much
next time we make her do it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:53</timestamp>
<p>-Well, no, she didn't complain.
-Whatever. Doesn't matter.
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>-Everything worked out.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>Listen, I'm sorry I flew off
the handle earlier
and tried to remove your robe by force.
</p><timestamp>00:24:03</timestamp>
<p>This is my first show
and I'm still figuring out
how to strike the right tone.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>No, of course, I'm just trying
to help you fulfill your vision.
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. The main thing
you gotta know about me
is just don't take things so personal,
you know what I mean?
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>Uh, yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:24:16</timestamp>
<p>Everything we're doing over
these next ten weeks,
the places I'm going to take you,
it's not about you, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:24:23</timestamp>
<p>-It's Philbert.
-Yeah. Right.
</p><timestamp>00:24:25</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, you get it.
