<p>{\an8}Good morning,
my name is Professor Horseman,
</p><timestamp>00:02:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}which will remain
on that whiteboard forever,
</p><timestamp>00:02:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and this is Intermediate Scene Study.
</p><timestamp>00:02:36</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What is acting? Anyone?
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all</subtitle> Ooh!
-Oh! Okay. You.
</p><timestamp>00:02:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}According to Stanislothski,
</p><timestamp>00:02:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}acting is the desire
to create inside of oneself
</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}another, deeper, more interesting life
</p><timestamp>00:02:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}than the one
that actually surrounds him...
or her.
</p><timestamp>00:02:50</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, okay, yes, but also... Yes?
-<subtitle>girl</subtitle> Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:02:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Meisner would say, "Acting is behaving
truthfully under imaginary circumstances."
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>Acting is behaving truthfully
under imaginary circumstances.
</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>Uh, okay, wow. So, that's acting.
But what is--?
</p><timestamp>00:03:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Guys, I'm concerned this class
is getting very theory-qua-theory...
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p> I was about to say that.
</p><timestamp>00:03:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}...when technique should be a means
toward a more engaging art.
</p><timestamp>00:03:11</timestamp>
<p>-Well, quite astute.
-Sorry, horse professor. What's acting?
</p><timestamp>00:03:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Um...
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Acting is the, um... <subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>Acting is...
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I don't know what acting is.
I don't know what I'm doing.
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>I shouldn't be here.
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>boy</subtitle> Wow.
-<subtitle>girl</subtitle> Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No, I don't want to quit.
I'm acting! That's acting.
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:03:34</timestamp>
<p>Class dismissed.
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p>But we still have
an hour and 20 minutes left.
</p><timestamp>00:03:38</timestamp>
<p>Yes. Again, I was acting.
</p><timestamp>00:03:40</timestamp>
<p>You sounded serious.
</p><timestamp>00:03:42</timestamp>
<p>Instead of judging my acting,
how about you act and I judge you?
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-For real?
-Yeah. Good point.
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We could show you the scenes
we were working on last semester.
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>Uh, sure.
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-This is from "Kablammo, Mother."
-Whenever you're ready.
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Mama, where's Daddy's old World War II
grenade with the pin still in it?
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>in British accent</subtitle> Why would you want
an old thing like that?
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>Tonight, I intend to explode myself.
Where are the extra towels?
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, okay. Stop, stop.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Does this play take place in England?
-<subtitle>normal voice</subtitle> No.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So why are you talking
with an English accent?
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>I'm acting.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>Just as an exercise,
maybe use your normal voice.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And Tawnie, when you're telling
your mother you're gonna kill yourself,
the next line is,
"Where are the extra towels," right?
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>And the character's being very casual,
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so maybe she should also be casual
when she says she's gonna kill herself.
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Like it's a big deal,
but it's not a big deal for her.
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>-Like that's the irony of the scene.
-Whoa! That's really smart.
</p><timestamp>00:04:35</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, it is.
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>Okay, let's see it again.
</p><timestamp>00:04:40</timestamp>
<p>So, darling, what fun and games
shall we play?
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>Shall we play Scattergories?
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>raspy voice</subtitle> I detest Scattergories!
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>Whatever the prompt,
you always answer in vague allusions
to the baby we never had!
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>Stop. You're both talking to the audience.
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>I want you to talk to each other,
you're having a conversation.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>-Hey! Who's you?
-Who's me? Screw you is who's me!
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>I got the leads.
The Gooba Gooberry Falls leads.
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>Mm! Them's them good leads.
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>-Hubba hubba, I'm horny for leads!
-Okay, here's my question for you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>Does your character
know he's horny for leads,
or is he discovering it?
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>Who's next? Great. What's the scene?
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>The scene is I'm late for my next class.
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>We were supposed to get out
20 minutes ago.
</p><timestamp>00:05:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh, shit. Sorry. See you Wednesday.
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>Great work today. Way to go, team.
</p><timestamp>00:05:27</timestamp>
<p>We did it. That was great, huh?
How good was I?
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
-<subtitle>door closes</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>Whitfield, we've been here six weeks.
How do you think this is going?
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>-I think I'm crushing it.
-Wow, okay. Well, I admire the confidence.
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>I know you're an acting major.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>And I guess I just-- I wanted to make sure
that you're taking other classes.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>Like, Economics,
or maybe a plumbing course.
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>Or rental car cashier class? I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>What would you want to do
if the acting thing doesn't work out?
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>Hold up, do you think
I'm not a good actor?
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>You said "Not a good actor."
But now that you've said it...
</p><timestamp>00:06:05</timestamp>
<p>Some would say there are no bad actors,
only bad teachers.
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>What about Jason Segel?
He was a bad actor in <i>Bad Teacher.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>I am a wonderful actor.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>You'll see.
</p><timestamp>00:06:16</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>door closes</subtitle>
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p>She knew I was drunk,
but she still let me drive off
with Jonathan.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, oh! I'm a drunk!
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>Jesus, I had no idea, I--
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>Booze has taken everything from me.
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>-My job as an airline pilot, my wife.
-Huh? What the--?
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>Those two things.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Okay. I see what's happening.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, everybody.
This is one of my acting students.
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>-He's trying to, um--
-Who's Whitfield?
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>
<p>-Nobody said "Whitfield."
-My name is Whip Whitaker.
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>-Did you follow me here?
-I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>Drove the plane upside-downsy.
Yeah, I'm drunk now.
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p>-Wow.
-No, don't--
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>We've all been there, man.
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p>He hasn't been there.
That's the plot of the movie <i>Flight.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:57</timestamp>
<p>Glug, glug, glug.
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>-That wet the ol' whistle.
-So sorry, everyone.
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>Now I'm completely over the 0.8 percent
blood alcohol level.
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>-I'm in trouble. I am wasted.
-This is very disrespectful.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>-Hammered...
-We work hard to create a safe space here.
</p><timestamp>00:07:11</timestamp>
<p>-...tanked, blitzed...
-So sorry about that. I recognize that.
</p><timestamp>00:07:13</timestamp>
<p>-...Irish, canned, smashed...
-I value this room, just know that.
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>-...annihilated, laced, faded.
-Really sorry about all of this.
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p>-So sorry.
-In conclusion, I am a drunk.
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>The big D.
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>-Fine. Shut up. You're a drunk.
-Aha! Wrong, I was acting!
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>It appears the student
has become the student-er.

<p>What is this, the Running of the Brides
at Filene's Basement?
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>Who's with me?

<p><subtitle>slurps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:03</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>-Um, they're allowed to do that in rugby.
-What? Really?
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>Also, nobody knows
what Filene's Basement is.
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>That's a shame. You definitely paid
too much for that coat.
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>whistle trills</subtitle>
-Oh, is it over? Did we win?
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>exhales</subtitle> Hey, you're really good.
I think.
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>Don't feel like you have to come
to these things if it's not your thing.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>No, I liked it. Look at us. Doing college.
</p><timestamp>00:08:26</timestamp>
<p>I'm just saying you have your things
and I have my things. It's okay.
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>-You wanna get something to eat?
-I-I can't.
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p>When we win,
we all go to Conspiracy to celebrate.
</p><timestamp>00:08:36</timestamp>
<p>-Sounds fun. Can I join you?
-I don't think you should.
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>It's a bar,
and there will be alcohol there.
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>-That's okay.
-And young girls.
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>-What's that have to do with anything?
-Nothing. Just stating a fact.
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>-Okay. Well, then, I guess I'll see you.
-Wouldn't wanna be you!
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>But I would. You're cool.
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>Hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>Yes, good. Keep doing what they're doing.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Tawnie,
you're Hollyhock's best friend...
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>-We're actually in a fight right now.
-Again?
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>Our fights are like Adele songs.
</p><timestamp>00:09:11</timestamp>
<p>All kind of the same one,
but with different specifics.
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p>-Well, do you understand this rugby thing?
-Uh, honestly? No.
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>She came back from winter break
super aggro, but that's Hollyhock, right?
</p><timestamp>00:09:21</timestamp>
<p>Suddenly, she decides,
"This is what I'm all about now,
and everyone else
just has to get on board."
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>What are we supposed to do with that?
</p><timestamp>00:09:27</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa!
-I guess... get on board.
</p><timestamp>00:09:31</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>whistle trills</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>Get it out, get it-- Yes, nice.
</p><timestamp>00:09:34</timestamp>
<p>Nice run! Very nice!
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>Touchdown! That's my sister!
</p><timestamp>00:09:38</timestamp>
<p>Good try!
</p><timestamp>00:09:39</timestamp>
<p>Try? She did it. She scored.
</p><timestamp>00:09:41</timestamp>
<p>It's called a try.
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p>Try to keep up.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>-Hey! Hey!
-<subtitle>sighing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah!

<p>As is customary. See footnote.
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>We know.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>What's up, rugger?
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>Two tries, two conversions,
and a drop goal?

<p>Jonah Lomu over here.
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>-Great game, Hock.
-Oh, Hock.
</p><timestamp>00:10:10</timestamp>
<p>I like it.
Can I get a nickname too, Regina?
</p><timestamp>00:10:13</timestamp>
<p>How about, "Professor Horseman,
adult faculty member"?
</p><timestamp>00:10:16</timestamp>
<p>-We have to go.
-Yeah, go.
</p><timestamp>00:10:18</timestamp>
<p>Go. See you.
See you on the scrumming pitch.

<p>Wait. Where's Hollyhock?
</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>
<p>You mean Hollyhock
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>Hey. What the hell? You quit rugby?
</p><timestamp>00:10:36</timestamp>
<p>God. You sound like three of my dads.
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p>-The other five were relieved.
-You were good.
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>I need to focus on my studies.
I'm not just here to get my ya-yas out.
</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but rugby's our thing.
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:48</timestamp>
<p>Okay, then I guess we'll just--
We'll find a new thing.
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>How about my thing is reading
<i>Gender Trouble </i>by Judith Butler,
and your thing is being a teacher?
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>Are you okay?
</p><timestamp>00:10:58</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> I'm just busy with school stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:11:00</timestamp>
<p>You got your showcase in a couple weeks?
</p><timestamp>00:11:02</timestamp>
<p>"An Evening of Modern American Scenes"?
</p><timestamp>00:11:04</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I'll-- I'll go to that.
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>-Great. I'll see you then.
-Yeah, see you then.
</p><timestamp>00:11:10</timestamp>
<p>Not if I see you first--!
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>phone ringing, beeps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>-Hello?
-Hey, listen.
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>-It's your very good accountant, Gaz.
-Hey, Gaz.
</p><timestamp>00:11:21</timestamp>
<p>I just noticed you spent
a lot of money last year.
</p><timestamp>00:11:24</timestamp>
<p>-Did you go to rehab? Like, a lot?
-You just noticed that?
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>I've got a ton of clients, okay?
And this was a big cocaine year for me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>But we're fine. Just make another movie,
and you'll be fine.
</p><timestamp>00:11:33</timestamp>
<p>-You're working on a movie?
<i>-No.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>Actually, I'm a college professor now.
</p><timestamp>00:11:36</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sputters</subtitle> What, do you hate money?
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>-<i>Gaz...</i>
-Ah, no, no, no, it's fine.
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>Basically, we're fine.
As I told my wife before she left me,
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>I'm not worried,
and you shouldn't be either.
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>We may need to unload some assets, though.
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>-You still own that restaurant?
-Elefante?
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>I'd love to dump that money pit,
but what idiot would buy it?
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>-Sold! On this arrangement.
-Of course you're sold. It was your idea.
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p>Explain it to me one more time?
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>Okay. You'll spend a lot of time
with international superstar
sex symbol, Joey Pogo,
building a close emotional bond.
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>After you've established that connection,
you'll share one magical evening
of intimate sexual congress,
after which, we'll finally be even.
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>You'll marry me, and the two of you
will never see each other again.
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>-Well, I guess it's worth a try.

<p>-<subtitle>phone beeps</subtitle>
-Hello? No?
</p><timestamp>00:12:20</timestamp>
<p>Really? Wow, hold on a sec.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>Pickles, should I buy Elefante?
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>Ooh! Then you'd be my husband and my boss.
</p><timestamp>00:12:27</timestamp>
<p>Like Ike and Tina Turn-- No.
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>-Well, I'm sure there are good examples.
-There must be.
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>But buying a restaurant's
a big commitment.
</p><timestamp>00:12:34</timestamp>
<p>What if I went in on it with you?
I like food.
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p>Great idea, Joey Pogo. I'm in!
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p>On you being in. On it. With me.
</p><timestamp>00:12:42</timestamp>
<p>I've got big ideas for this place.
</p><timestamp>00:12:44</timestamp>
<p>One word-- lazy Susans.
</p><timestamp>00:12:47</timestamp>
<p>Hold on.
</p><timestamp>00:12:47</timestamp>
<p>Before we make any rash decisions,
should we maybe consider the long-term...
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>stammers</subtitle> Pickles, this guy on the phone
is waiting, and I don't want to be rude.
</p><timestamp>00:12:56</timestamp>
<p>Sorry. Of course.
Finish your conversation.
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>-Sold!

</p><timestamp>00:13:00</timestamp>

<p>Lazy Susans.

<p><subtitle>raspy voice</subtitle> Oh, Heidi,
you'll never bag a man
with all your talk of feminism,
and your grandfather in Switzerland,
and all your little goat friends--
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>Stop. Terry, this character is 28.
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>Is that what you think
a 28-year-old sounds like?
</p><timestamp>00:13:19</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>normal voice</subtitle> I mean, yes?
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>You do the same old-man voice
for every character.
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>Gotta have a gimmick if I'm gonna make it
in the show business.
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>In "the show business,"
when they have old man characters,
they cast real old men.
</p><timestamp>00:13:29</timestamp>
<p>-I'll show you.
-Please don't.
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p>You'll see.
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>We still have 20 minutes of class left.
</p><timestamp>00:13:38</timestamp>
<p>I'd driven across that bridge drunk
hundreds of times, but never on black ice.

<p>-<subtitle>door opens</subtitle>
-<subtitle>Terry in raspy voice</subtitle> Back in my day,
</p><timestamp>00:13:44</timestamp>
<p>-we called that "the hidden slipperies."
-Oh, no.
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>But we didn't go to meetings
and talk about our problems.
</p><timestamp>00:13:50</timestamp>
<p>-No, we made moonshine in bathtubs.
-Please leave. Now.
</p><timestamp>00:13:53</timestamp>
<p>-Who's Terry?
-Nobody said Terry.
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>Mind if I sit a spell?
These old bones need a rest.
</p><timestamp>00:13:57</timestamp>
<p>Sure, take it easy.
</p><timestamp>00:13:58</timestamp>
<p>Everyone, this is another one
of my students.
</p><timestamp>00:14:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm very sorry, I have no idea
why they think this is gonna impress me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:04</timestamp>
<p>I just relieved myself in my adult diaper.
</p><timestamp>00:14:07</timestamp>
<p>Terry...
</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>
<p>Here I am, in the twilight of my years,
having drunk it all away.
</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p>-My job as an airline pilot...
-Wow.
</p><timestamp>00:14:14</timestamp>
<p>-My son...
-You don't have a son.
</p><timestamp>00:14:16</timestamp>
<p>Not anymore I don't,
because I abandoned him.
</p><timestamp>00:14:19</timestamp>
<p>I abandoned my boy!
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Whitfield</subtitle> Papa?

</p><timestamp>00:14:22</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God.

<p>I've gone blind, me has,

</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my sweet child!
</p><timestamp>00:14:31</timestamp>
<p>Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>Todd, why don't you and Ruthie
go for a stroll
while I talk to these acting students?
</p><timestamp>00:14:40</timestamp>
<p>She's just a baby, and I don't want
to expose her to too much desperation.
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>-You got it, boss.
-<subtitle>Ruthie giggles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>Today, we have a very special guest.
</p><timestamp>00:14:48</timestamp>
<p>This is my friend, Princess Carolyn,
who was nice enough to come here
to talk about the business of acting.
</p><timestamp>00:14:55</timestamp>
<p>So, please do not embarrass me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:58</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no.
</p><timestamp>00:14:59</timestamp>
<p>How many months
until people get discovered, usually?
</p><timestamp>00:15:02</timestamp>
<p>One? Two? <subtitle>gasps</subtitle> Three?
</p><timestamp>00:15:05</timestamp>
<p>This is more of a comment than a question,
but I've seen every Robert Altman movie.
</p><timestamp>00:15:09</timestamp>
<p>What's the best diner to be discovered in
drinking a milkshake?
</p><timestamp>00:15:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>
<p>What if I want to do nudity?
Do I still have to sign a waiver?
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p>Huh!
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>yawns</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:21</timestamp>
<p>Whoo!
</p><timestamp>00:15:23</timestamp>
<p>Hey, who's the kid
that didn't ask a question?
</p><timestamp>00:15:25</timestamp>
<p>-The brooding kid in the back.
-Oh, that's Stan.
</p><timestamp>00:15:28</timestamp>
<p>That kid's got it.
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>The look, the sauce,
the power to make me feel
like a 13-year-old girl,
and to make a 13-year-old girl
feel like a woman.
</p><timestamp>00:15:36</timestamp>
<p>I wanna cast him.
</p><timestamp>00:15:37</timestamp>
<p>-You haven't even seen him act.
-Is he good?
</p><timestamp>00:15:39</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> He's the best actor I got.
</p><timestamp>00:15:42</timestamp>
<p>I had my doubts
when he did the scene from <i>Proof,</i>
but when he did the scene from <i>Doubt,</i>
I thought, "There's the proof."
</p><timestamp>00:15:47</timestamp>
<p>-I have to sign him.
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p>Stan needs to finish school.
He's a sophomore.
</p><timestamp>00:15:51</timestamp>
<p>Great! A legal adult but he looks young.
</p><timestamp>00:15:53</timestamp>
<p>He can play all the roles that other
young, impressionable actors can't
because they keep ODing,
or going to prison, or going to rehab,
or killing themselves.
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p>-No, he's not ready.
-Why don't we let Stan decide?
</p><timestamp>00:16:05</timestamp>
<p>I want to be your manager.
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>And I can get you Brooding Birthday Boy
on "Birthday Dad" right now.
</p><timestamp>00:16:12</timestamp>
<p>Stan, LA's not going anywhere.
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>
<p>But you need an education,
something to keep you grounded.
</p><timestamp>00:16:16</timestamp>
<p>Stan, look at me.
You have an opportunity now.
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>What do you need, a piece of paper?
You're done with this place.
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>Stan? Stan. Stan, Stan.
</p><timestamp>00:16:24</timestamp>
<p>One day, you're gonna look back
and realize these days on campus,
they were the last days
you were truly free.
</p><timestamp>00:16:31</timestamp>
<p>You want "free"?
</p><timestamp>00:16:32</timestamp>

was to get to a place like this,
and I didn't even know it.
</p><timestamp>00:16:40</timestamp>
<p>Out there, there's nothing to protect you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:42</timestamp>
<p>No, but there's a Patagonia jacket
that says "Birthday Dad" on it
that you get from being on "Birthday Dad."
</p><timestamp>00:16:48</timestamp>
<p>We're safe here, Stan.
Please, don't make the mistake I did.
</p><timestamp>00:16:52</timestamp>
<p>Come on, you'll get your own chair
with your name on it!

<p>Thanks! <subtitle>munching</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:20</timestamp>
<p>That was for the child.
</p><timestamp>00:17:21</timestamp>
<p>Oh, should've specified.
</p><timestamp>00:17:23</timestamp>
<p>If she can abstain from eating
the marshmallow for 15 minutes,
she'll receive an even bigger reward.
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>An even bigger reward than a marshmallow?
</p><timestamp>00:17:31</timestamp>

-Don't be a sucker, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:17:45</timestamp>
<p>Eat the marshmallow.
</p><timestamp>00:17:47</timestamp>
<p>Who knows what the world's gonna be like
in 15 minutes?
</p><timestamp>00:17:49</timestamp>

We've got to find another marshmallow!

<p>-<subtitle>phone buzzes, beeps</subtitle>
-Hey, Todd. You've got the Maude Squad.
</p><timestamp>00:18:00</timestamp>
<p>Just kidding, it's just Maude.
I don't have a squad.
</p><timestamp>00:18:02</timestamp>
<p>Maude? I didn't go to college.
</p><timestamp>00:18:04</timestamp>
<p>-Where can I get a marshmallow?
-The dining hall?
</p><timestamp>00:18:06</timestamp>
<p>Dining hall?
This is Wesleyan, not Hogwarts.
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>What's in a marshmallow anyway?
Maybe I can make one.
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p>I think they're mostly chemicals.
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>To the chemistry lab!

<p>-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle> You! Make me a marshmallow!

</p><timestamp>00:18:24</timestamp>
<p>That's not important right now!
</p><timestamp>00:18:26</timestamp>
<p>If I don't get a new marshmallow,
some psychiatrist
is gonna get mad at this baby.
</p><timestamp>00:18:30</timestamp>
<p>A psychiatrist?
</p><timestamp>00:18:32</timestamp>
<p>I am so sick of the soft sciences
wagging the dog
in conversations
of behavioral development.
</p><timestamp>00:18:37</timestamp>
<p>Let's teach them a lesson!
</p><timestamp>00:18:52</timestamp>
<p>-I'm sorry, but the experiment's over.
-What? Why?
</p><timestamp>00:18:55</timestamp>
<p>Because you ate the marshmallow.
Good day, sir.

<p>Doctor?

<p>Hello, my name is Willie Wesleyan,
and you've won the school, my boy!
</p><timestamp>00:19:09</timestamp>
<p>Wesleyan University is yours.
</p><timestamp>00:19:12</timestamp>
<p>What? Why?
</p><timestamp>00:19:14</timestamp>
<p>Somebody needs to keep
that stuffy old board of trustees in check
once I've shed this mortal skin.
</p><timestamp>00:19:20</timestamp>
<p>-Oh...
-Sorry about that.
</p><timestamp>00:19:22</timestamp>
<p>We're doing LSD research

</p><timestamp>00:19:29</timestamp>
<p>Yes, Mr. Phillips,
everything tastes like something.
</p><timestamp>00:19:35</timestamp>
<p>So this is college.
</p><timestamp>00:19:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>drum roll</subtitle>

<p><subtitle>knocks on door</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:42</timestamp>
<p>-You wanted to see me?
-Amy, yeah. Um, have a seat.
</p><timestamp>00:19:45</timestamp>
<p>So we're nearing
the end of the semester here,
and I'm putting together the cast sheet
for the student showcase.
</p><timestamp>00:19:50</timestamp>
<p>-Uh-huh.
-This showcase is a big deal.
</p><timestamp>00:19:53</timestamp>
<p>This might sound crazy coming from
famous television star, BoJack Horseman,
but in some ways,
this showcase means even more to me
than the very popular TV shows
that, again, I was the star of.
</p><timestamp>00:20:04</timestamp>
<p>-It means a lot to me, too.
-Does it?
</p><timestamp>00:20:06</timestamp>
<p>'Cause you've been missing
a lot of classes.
</p><timestamp>00:20:07</timestamp>
<p>And forgetting your lines.
You seem tired all the time, and...
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p>I can be better. I'll prove it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:13</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:20:15</timestamp>
<p>As the water rose, I remember
fumbling through the glove compartment,
just praying
that I could find a pin hammer
so I could shatter the window.
</p><timestamp>00:20:22</timestamp>
<p>-Uh, excuse me, is this...
-No. Nope, no, no, no. Get out of here.
</p><timestamp>00:20:26</timestamp>
<p>-This has to stop.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>
<p>This is a place for people who are serious
about making a change,
not for desperate acting students
pretending to have problems, Amy.
</p><timestamp>00:20:34</timestamp>
<p>I was just trying to get help!
</p><timestamp>00:20:35</timestamp>
<p>-Oof!
-<subtitle>crying</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>Oh! Oops! That was...
</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>Oops.
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, do you know what this show's about?
-I think it's about to start.
</p><timestamp>00:20:53</timestamp>
<p>So keep your rugby voice
on the field, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>It turns out my hypothesis was correct.
Kids love marshmallows.
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>You don't say.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>You still working on that memoir?
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>Well, funny story about that...
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I love when stories start like that!
Ooh! You should put this one in your book.
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>Where the hell is she?
</p><timestamp>00:21:13</timestamp>
<p>Horse professor, we're ready when you are.

That's very nice, thank you.

<p>Welcome to
"An Evening of Modern American Scenes."
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>The students are very excited
to perform for you tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:21:31</timestamp>
<p>They've come such a long way
over the course of the semester.
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>Like, a really-- a really long way.
They were very bad before.
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>But now...
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>Well, I mean,
you'll see for yourself, uh...
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>But, um, I'm proud of them.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, first up is a scene
from Sam German-Shepherd's "Real America."
</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>crowd whooping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>You think real America's
all about cowboys?
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>line ringing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>Well, I say real America's about business!
And capitalism!
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>voicemail</subtitle> <i>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</i>
-Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p><i>-Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</i>
-God damn it.
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>I'm starting to think the real America
is me kicking your ass!
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>BoJack? Oh, shit, your showcase!
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>Tawnie's gonna be so pissed!
</p><timestamp>00:22:17</timestamp>
<p>Forget Tawnie. I'm pissed!
And it's happening right now.
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. I forgot.
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>I know your students just have to do
a scene, but I have multiple final papers.
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>If you're implying
acting is a bullshit major, you're right.
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>But people came all the way
from California to see my showcase.
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>From Chicago.
You can't even walk across campus?
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>Okay, let me put some pants on.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>-You've been avoiding me all semester.
-I just have a lot going on.
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>I go to school here.
I'm a college student.
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p>-I thought I'd see you more.
-This was mine before you got here.
</p><timestamp>00:22:45</timestamp>
<p>This was my life, my world,
and you just, like, live here now.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>And you could have asked me, by the way.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I'm sorry.
I guess I thought my sister...
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
<p>No, don't say that.
Like it means something.
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>-It does mean something.
-We don't know each other, really.
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-No, I'm just saying it's fine.
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>I had a life before I met you,
and you had a life before you met me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>I don't want that life.
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>That life, that person?
That's not who I am, I...
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry I came here
without asking you first.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>That was selfish.
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>If this is too weird for you,
I don't have to come back next semester.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>I can get a job somewhere else.
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>Tawnie says you're a really good teacher.
</p><timestamp>00:23:30</timestamp>
<p>She did? Huh.
I thought you were in a fight.
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but I still love her.
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>Are we in a fight?
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>I should get back to the show.
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>If you want to come back in the fall,
that could be cool.
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah?
-Just...
</p><timestamp>00:23:48</timestamp>
<p>We need to take things slow, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I know.
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p>Thanks.

<p>The reporters who keep trying

<p>What-- What reporters?

<p>Whatever they're doing,
I don't want to be included, okay?

<p>I don't want my daughter to be included.

<p>Charlotte, I swear, I don't know
what you're talking about.
