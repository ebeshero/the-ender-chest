<i>Look alive, bright eyes.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p><i>It's the morning and somebody loves you.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>Right back at you, buddy.
</p><timestamp>00:00:20</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God. He's here.
-There he is.
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>-I love you, Mr. Peanutbutter.
-I love you, too.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>Idea for a new Pixar movie:
what are pizza boxes thinking about?
</p><timestamp>00:00:31</timestamp>
<p>-And Leland Stanford?
-Transcontinental Railroad.
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>-Transcontinental Railroad?
-That is correct.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>Next question,
what is my favorite kind of berry?
</p><timestamp>00:00:41</timestamp>
<p>-Barry Bostwick.
-Raspberry?
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p>I'm so sorry, the correct answer,
of course, was Barry Bostwick.
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p>-How was I supposed to know?
-He also likes Franken Berry.
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>-We would have accepted Franken Berry.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:00:51</timestamp>
<p>-I'm sorry, you lose.
-What the...?
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>That's our show, but before we go
I wanna send out a quick message.
</p><timestamp>00:00:57</timestamp>
<p>Diane, if you're watching this, I love you
and I know you're doing great things.
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>Idea for a new app: an undo button
that could undo long amounts of time.
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha!
-Three months. A year. A life.
</p><timestamp>00:01:15</timestamp>
<p>Erica, where did that tooth come from?
All right, let's keep this party going.
</p><timestamp>00:01:20</timestamp>
<p>One click and everything could
just go back to the way it was.

<p>-Hey.
-<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:01:31</timestamp>
<p>-You're still here?
-Yup. Still here.

</p><timestamp>00:02:34</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>snoring, then grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Stop it.
-Wake up, captain dumbshit.
</p><timestamp>00:02:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I've been trying to get in touch
with you for two months.
</p><timestamp>00:02:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ow. Okay. I'm awake, I'm awake.
</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Aah! What is it?
</p><timestamp>00:02:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}If the studio wants to sue me, tell them
to take my house. I belong to the sea now.
</p><timestamp>00:02:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Are you drunk?
-Only on adventure. And gin.
</p><timestamp>00:02:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And vodka. And gin.
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}They're not gonna sue you.
They finished the movie.
</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What? How? Explain yourself, land wench.
-I don't know, ask Turteltaub.
</p><timestamp>00:03:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's not why I'm here.
I thought you were in Cordovia.
</p><timestamp>00:03:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You've been here this whole time?
</p><timestamp>00:03:09</timestamp>
<p>Idea for a thing Princess Carolyn
should do... Shut up.
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Get dressed.
We're going to the orphanage.
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>grunts</subtitle> What orphanage?
</p><timestamp>00:03:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Remember at Herb's funeral,
I asked you what you wanted me to do
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-with your <i>Horsin' Around </i>residuals?
-I do... not remember that.
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You said, "Give it to an orphanage
or something."
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What?
-It turns out you made enough money
</p><timestamp>00:03:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}to build a brand new one.
So congratulations. You're a hero.
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>A hero?
</p><timestamp>00:03:34</timestamp>
<p>That's right, a hero.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Or is it pronounced "gyro?"
I just call them subs.
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Anyway, enjoy the sandwich,
you're a great man.
</p><timestamp>00:03:42</timestamp>
<p>Welcome to
The BoJack Horseman Orphanage.
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Or, as we call it,
The BoJack Horsephanage.
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You cannot call it that.
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A, because I am not a great man and B,
because that is a really stupid name.
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-The name was Molly's idea.
-Stop pissing off the orphans.
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A lot of them grow up
to be serial killers.

</p><timestamp>00:04:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Thank you for that lovely song.
But I'm not a good person.
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}This is the only good thing I've ever done
and I did it by accident.
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And it just goes to show you
life is just... Ah, what am I saying?
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I don't have to tell you how hard life is.
You're the ones with the dead parents.
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>-My parents are dead?
-No. No. Not necessarily.
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>Maybe they just didn't want you.
</p><timestamp>00:04:35</timestamp>
<p>My point is,
I don't understand how people live.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It's amazing to me that people
wake up every morning
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and say, "Yeah, another day, let's do it."
How do people do it?
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>I don't know how.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>Yay.
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>So you see, Todd, the nimble improviser
must navigate the most sensitive of areas.
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>-And I'm not just talking about the butt.
-Ha.
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>Copernicus, how do you always come
up with these amazing butt jokes?
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>When you're a Level Nine, as I am,
you don't come up with butt jokes.
</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p>You live truthfully in the moment
and the butt joke comes to you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>So true. So wise.
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>Listen, I need to "shove off,"
as we sailors say,
on my comedy cruise line, the <i>Giggleship.</i>
I shan't be returning.
</p><timestamp>00:05:27</timestamp>
<p>-Shan't you?
-I shannot.
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>I'd like you to join me on the high seas,
as my Number Two
and I don't mean<i> that</i> kind of number two.
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>What, number two, how do you do that?
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p>If it isn't the furshlugginer putz
who cost me 50 grand.
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of
production. If there's anything I can do.
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>Do? What do? Movie's finished.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>-We fixed the whole thing in post.
-Really?
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>Remember your first week, these nerds
made a computer scan of your head
so we could finish
if something happened?
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>Please don't call us nerds, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>Something happened to you,
so these nerds finished the movie.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>Look what Computer BoJack can do.
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p><i>-Help you out of that tree, ma'am?</i>
-Look at him save that cat.
</p><timestamp>00:06:07</timestamp>
<p>Now there's a protagonist
we can root for.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>-You did all that in the computer?
-Not just that.
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>Computer BoJack had so much charisma
and screen presence we ended up going back
</p><timestamp>00:06:16</timestamp>
<p>-and replacing you in every scene.
-I'm not in the movie at all?
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>Not technically, but computer you
is giving the performance of your career.
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p>When people see what you do in this movie,
they are gonna storm
Daniel Day-Lewis's house,
schlep him out into the street,
shoot him in the head.
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p>That's how good your performance is.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>It's gonna make Daniel Day-Lewis
look like shit.
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>-They're gonna hate Daniel Day-Lewis.
-But it's not my performance.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>Explain that the widow Day-Lewis.
She'll be devastated. Kaput. Kapleshky.
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>Are you Jewish? Because I feel
some of these you're just making up.
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>We got a screening this weekend.
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>Come see the movie,
we'll schmooze, we'll kibitz,
schlemiel, schlimazel,
Hasenpfeffer Incorporated.
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>Just think, Carolyn,
in one week, all of this will be ours.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>We should a put a social-media desk there.
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>If we hire someone to micromanage
our clients' online personas
and new media outreach, they'll seem
more grounded down to earth.
</p><timestamp>00:07:07</timestamp>
<p>Smiling poop emoji,
I love everything about that.
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>I wanna make sure the couches
we get are really comfortable.
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>-Just in case we have some late nights.
-<subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Mr. Rabitowitz.
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>This is a place of business.
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>Ugh, can we just freeze in this moment
for a second?
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>I just wanna remember this instant
where for once in my life,
</p><timestamp>00:07:27</timestamp>
<p>-everything was going--
-Hold that thought.
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>What is it?
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. My wife and I are going
to the ballet tonight,
there's a real ish
with the restaurant.
</p><timestamp>00:07:34</timestamp>
<p>-This is the wife you're divorcing, right?
-You know how it is.
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>You say you want a divorce
and she says, "No, we can make this work."
</p><timestamp>00:07:40</timestamp>
<p>You go to counseling and
remember why you fell in love with her
in the first place
and then, blah, blah, it's a whole thing.
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>We've been sleeping together
for three months.
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>-We're about to start a company together.
-None of that has to change.
</p><timestamp>00:07:51</timestamp>
<p>I am definitely going to divorce
her probably, it's just...
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. It's hard to explain to someone
who's never been married.
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>-Listen, this is--
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, Katie just said something funny.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-I gotta hop. I love you, though.
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>Ha, ha. Okay, keep the engine running,
I'll be back in a-- Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p>-Hey.
-Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff.
I'm going away for a while.
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, where?
-The <i>Giggleship.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>It's the comedy cruise line
<i>People </i>magazine
</p><timestamp>00:08:26</timestamp>
<p>-once called "a comedy cruise line."
-Comedy cruise line?
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>Oh right, your improv thing.
How was your, uh, graduation show?
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>-It was two months ago. You missed it.
-Sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>-No, you're not.
-Well...
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>Hey, do you remember the morning
after my first night here?
</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>
<p>I don't know why everyone keeps asking
if I remember things. I don't.
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>Just as a general rule,
if your question begins, "Do you remember"
and doesn't end with "how much you hated
<i>Moulin Rouge," </i>the answer's no.
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>I was so happy to have a place
to stay that I made pancakes.
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>And you kept eating them
so I kept making them.
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>And then you got mad at me
for letting you eat so many pancakes.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>You tried to chase me around the pool,
but you were too hungover
and also full from the pancakes
so instead... you took a nap.
</p><timestamp>00:09:12</timestamp>
<p>And when you woke up, you said,
"Thanks for the pancakes.
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>-Now get out of my house."
-I don't remember any of that.
</p><timestamp>00:09:20</timestamp>
<p>Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out,
just like you wanted.
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>Good. Honestly, you'll probably
be better off without me.
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. But we had some good times,
though, right?
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>-Did we?
-Right. Well, um, take care.
</p><timestamp>00:09:39</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I hope you can find a way
to be happy, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p>-I really do.
-Yeah, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Todd?
</p><timestamp>00:09:51</timestamp>
<p>You need to get your shit together.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>-Ugh.
-Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency.
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>I want you to come onboard
and write celebrity tweets.
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>-I don't know how to do that.
-You're a ghost-writer.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>It's the same as writing a book,
they're just a lot shorter
and more people read them.
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>All right, but why are you helping me?
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>Because my life is a mess right now and I
compulsively take care of other people
when I don't know how
to take care of myself.
</p><timestamp>00:10:16</timestamp>
<p>Oh. I was hoping it was
because you believed in me.
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>I don't.
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>Welcome to my <i>Giggleship.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:10:26</timestamp>
<p>For us, it's a place to realize
our higher selves. For the paying public,
it's a place to watch improv and drink
watered-down margaritas for 8.99.
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>Wow, we must all make a lot of money.
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>No, no, you just get paid
in experience and stage time.
</p><timestamp>00:10:42</timestamp>
<p>-Which in a way is even better than money.
-Say what?
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>Look, We've arrived
at your living quarters.
</p><timestamp>00:10:48</timestamp>
<p>Wow. No more couch-sleeping for this guy.
He gets a mattress.
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>That's the spirit.
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>And you can use improv to make
this room anything you want it to be.
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>My cabin is exactly like yours,
but when I use my imagination,
it becomes a rich stateroom
with a treasure chest full of booty.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>I like a big booty, if you know what
I mean. And I don't mean a butt.

There's no turning back now.

<p>-Oh, I am ready.
-Great.
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p>Now let's get out there and tell all those
garbage rat bastard sons of bastards
what we really think of them,
once and for all.
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>Everyone. We have an announcement.

-Guys, we have an announcement.
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>-What's going on?
-Mr. Witherspoon's in the hospital.
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>-He had a stroke.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p>Well, you know what you rat bastards
can stroke?

-Oh, Bryan.
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>Please. My knees were cramping
so I needed to stand.
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>But I'm real good at cleaning windows.
Look.
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>That's solid space-work.
Bryan, don't worry.
</p><timestamp>00:12:20</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna go to Copernicus
and get this sorted out.

<p>-Copernicus is a fraud!
-A fraud? Me? Ow.
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>-Aah.
-I had such high hopes for you, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p>Normally, I'd make a perfectly
timed butt joke here,
but as you can see,
I don't have my book.
</p><timestamp>00:13:00</timestamp>
<p>-Oh!
-Guards, take this subversive
to the Yes And room.
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-Hey, what are you doing?
</p><timestamp>00:13:07</timestamp>
<p>No. Shame on all of you! Just wait
till you see my Trip Advisor review.
</p><timestamp>00:13:12</timestamp>
<p>This cruise is getting three stars.
</p><timestamp>00:13:14</timestamp>
<p>Because I have very
mixed feelings about it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:21</timestamp>
<p>-Carolyn, we are free.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:13:24</timestamp>
<p>Real quick, kiss me once.
Then kiss me twice.
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to do that anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>-I told you, we can make this work--
-No. I don't want--
</p><timestamp>00:13:32</timestamp>
<p>Carolyn, you're a single woman
in your 40s.
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>-Can you really afford to be picky?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>I'm just saying, what, you think you're
gonna find some perfect unattached guy
who's gonna love you like I do?
</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>Who's gonna make you laugh
and feel good about yourself?
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>This is it, Carolyn, this is what you get.
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>If you're holding out
for something better,
well, I hate to break it to you, but
you're gonna be alone for a long time.
</p><timestamp>00:13:53</timestamp>
<p>I'm not afraid of being alone.
</p><timestamp>00:13:57</timestamp>
<p>And you might wanna find
someplace else to work
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>-because you're not coming with me.
-Wait, wait, wait, what?
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>It's my company.
My name is on all the paperwork.
</p><timestamp>00:14:05</timestamp>
<p>I think I can do it without you.
Good luck.
</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa, Carolyn, we just-- Come... Carolyn.

this is the year of Secretariat.

<p>-Aah!

</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>-Ana Spanikopita. Big fan.
-Thank you, it's--
</p><timestamp>00:14:56</timestamp>
<p>I meant you are going to be
a big fan of me
because I am going
to win you an Oscar.
</p><timestamp>00:15:01</timestamp>
<p>Ana is the best there is.
</p><timestamp>00:15:03</timestamp>
<p>-You better start writing your speech.
-I don't have to thank my parents, do I?
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>You're funny.
I am literally laughing out loud.
</p><timestamp>00:15:09</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-We gotta get you on a talk show.
</p><timestamp>00:15:10</timestamp>
<p>You have any weird history
with Kelly Ripa I should know about?
</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>
<p>-No. Well, define "weird."
-You look doughy. Do you run?
</p><timestamp>00:15:17</timestamp>
<p>-Cardio? Anything?
-I mean, occasionally.
</p><timestamp>00:15:20</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me?
That was such a beautiful performance.
</p><timestamp>00:15:23</timestamp>
<p>-So brave.
-Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:15:25</timestamp>
<p>Everyone here loves you.
Do you feel that?
</p><timestamp>00:15:28</timestamp>
<p>-Feel that energy!
-They don't love me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:30</timestamp>
<p>-They don't know me.
-That's why they love you.
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>He's right. Our research shows
America likes to <i>think</i> they know you,
and then they like learning more
about you, but at a certain point
they pass a threshold where they actually
know you and then they find you weird
and off-putting.
</p><timestamp>00:15:45</timestamp>
<p>Are you saying that nobody who really
knows me could ever love me?
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p>-No, no, no. Not nobody. No.
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:15:51</timestamp>
<p>What am I doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:15:53</timestamp>
<p>I don't know where you're going,
but if you could run there.
</p><timestamp>00:16:08</timestamp>
<p>Sextina, hi. Thanks for meeting me here.
I'm really excited to be working with you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:17:02</timestamp>
<p>Hey. Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:17:04</timestamp>
<p>So... How's Cordovia?
</p><timestamp>00:17:09</timestamp>
<p>It's... hard.
</p><timestamp>00:17:11</timestamp>
<p>-Do you know where the batteries are?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:17:17</timestamp>
<p>-The batteries in the remote died.
-Did you check the junk drawer?
</p><timestamp>00:17:22</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I looked in the junk drawer.
</p><timestamp>00:17:24</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna take them
out of the smoke detector.
</p><timestamp>00:17:26</timestamp>
<p>-No, don't do that.
-Well, I'm out of options.
</p><timestamp>00:17:29</timestamp>
<p>Listen, I know this sounds crazy, but I
think maybe you should get back here
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>-so you can help me find the batteries.
-Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:17:39</timestamp>
<p>I know you're doing important work
and it's a long way to travel,
but I need you here
and I think you should come home.
</p><timestamp>00:17:46</timestamp>
<p>-Is that really what you want?
-Of course it is.
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>Well, okay, I'm looking
at this website right now
and it says if I leave immediately,
I can still make it home tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:18:01</timestamp>
<p>-That sounds great.
-I love you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:05</timestamp>
<p>I love you, too, Diane.
You know, it's the funniest thing.
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>There is a woman in this restaurant
who looks just like you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>Okay, party people,
we have time for one more suggestion.
</p><timestamp>00:18:23</timestamp>
<p>-Todd.
-Did someone say movie theater?
</p><timestamp>00:18:25</timestamp>
<p>I heard movie theater.
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>
<p>I'm Abe Lincoln and I'm gonna wear
my giant hat to the movies.
</p><timestamp>00:18:31</timestamp>
<p>Who's this sitting behind me?
John Wilkes Booth. Uh-oh.
</p><timestamp>00:18:35</timestamp>
<p>-Todd, it's me, BoJack.
-BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:18:39</timestamp>
<p>-Todd, I'm getting you out of here.
-I can't leave.
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>I need to take suggestions.
</p><timestamp>00:18:43</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, here's a suggestion,
your name is Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:18:47</timestamp>
<p>You're 24, you live on my couch and
you've always seen the good in me somehow.
</p><timestamp>00:18:54</timestamp>
<p>You've been brainwashed into thinking
that you belong here, but you don't.
You belong back home.
</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>If you're any kind of improviser,
you'll take that suggestion
and you'll run with it.
</p><timestamp>00:19:02</timestamp>
<p>Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:19:05</timestamp>
<p>Let's get out of here.
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p>I'm afraid that getting out of here
is not an option.
</p><timestamp>00:19:10</timestamp>
<p>-You've seen too much.
-What the hell are you gonna do about it?
</p><timestamp>00:19:14</timestamp>
<p>-Stop you. With these.
-Oh, no.
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>
<p>-Don't do anything crazy, guys.
-You can't be serious.
</p><timestamp>00:19:20</timestamp>
<p>-Just get behind me, BoJack.
-No sudden moves.
</p><timestamp>00:19:22</timestamp>
<p>Be reasonable.
You wouldn't wanna puncture the hull.
</p><timestamp>00:19:25</timestamp>
<p>Especially not when I have this
smoke bomb. Ka-pow!
</p><timestamp>00:19:29</timestamp>
<p>-I've lost them. Where did they go?
-Seriously?
</p><timestamp>00:19:31</timestamp>
<p>Now feel the wrath of my flamethrower.
</p><timestamp>00:19:36</timestamp>
<p>Too bad we're wearing sunscreen
with SPF a million which protects
against flamethrowers.
</p><timestamp>00:19:42</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no.
</p><timestamp>00:19:43</timestamp>
<p>Now we finish this
with our strangle machine.
</p><timestamp>00:19:46</timestamp>
<p>Beep, boop, boop. Machine?
</p><timestamp>00:19:48</timestamp>
<p>-Strangle those guys.

</p><timestamp>00:20:01</timestamp>

<p>Beep, boop.
</p><timestamp>00:20:26</timestamp>
<p>Come on, come on, come on.
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>Come on, come on, Todd.
Almost there.
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p>Wait. Where are you going?
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, improv is fun
and great and everything,
but you guys are <i>really</i> into improv.
I'm gonna go with my friend.
</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>Your friend?
I didn't realize this man was your friend.
</p><timestamp>00:20:43</timestamp>
<p>Well, then, by all means,
go with him, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p>But, see, I thought this was the man
who sabotaged your rock opera.
</p><timestamp>00:20:51</timestamp>
<p>The one who constantly abuses you and
makes you shower with a hose in the yard.
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>I invited him to.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>The one who's never said a kind word
to you the entire time you've known him.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>-Is this your friend, Todd?
-It's more complicated than that.
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>-Is it? We're your friends, Todd.
-More than that, we're a family.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>-I, uh...
-Hash browns.
</p><timestamp>00:21:15</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-I heard hash browns.
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>-Martha, did you see my hash browns?
-Oh, my God, do you ever turn it off?
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>It was hash browns, not pancakes.
The first morning you stayed with me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:24</timestamp>
<p>You kept making them and I kept eating
them and then I threw up in the pool.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>That made you throw up in the pool. Then I
got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.
</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>-But, you said, "I'll clean it up."
-And did I clean it up?
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>No. You didn't.
I had to call the pool cleaner.
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>-Ha, ha.
-And you said,
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>"Thank you for letting me stay here.
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p>I don't have anywhere else to go."
And I remember when you said that,
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>"I don't have anywhere else to go,"
because I felt good about myself.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>And I don't feel that way a lot.
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>Letting you stay with me
was the best thing I ever did on purpose.
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>I don't think I ever told you that.
But I should have.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>Because you're my best friend, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna lie, if you just made all
that up, that was some really good improv.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>Game recognize game.
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>

-Uh, I don't remember.

</p><timestamp>00:22:17</timestamp>
<p>-Hello? Prince?
-Listen, bozo, I keep getting calls
from this New York playwright,
she really wants to talk to you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>-She says you know her, Jill Pill?
-Jill Pill?
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p>Ring any bells?
Apparently, she worked on your TV show.
</p><timestamp>00:22:30</timestamp>
<p>-Horsin' Around?
-No, actually. The other TV show.
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>Other TV show? Oh, shit. Jill.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>I'm moving into the new office
and I got Herb's ashes here.
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>I really don't know what
to do with this thing.
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>

-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:22:45</timestamp>
<p>Why did I take you with me?
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>Herb loved orphans.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>Mostly as a delivery apparatus
for hackneyed punchlines
and mawkish sentimentality, but still.
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>And we will do our part
to honor his legacy.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, who's Jerb?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>Jerb Ka-- Why does it say "Jerb Kazzaz?"
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>Your e-mail said "Jerb."
I forwarded it to the plaque guy.
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>-Is it not--?
-No, obviously that was a typo.
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage
to the memory of Jerb Kazzaz?
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p>Kind of sounds like something you'd get
at a Mediterranean restaurant,
but wouldn't finish.
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>And the waiter would say, "You want me
to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?"
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>-And you'd say, "No."
-You gotta fix this.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>Really? We spent a lot of money
on this plaque, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>
<p>-And on the t-shirts.
-Jerb's kids?
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p>No, there's no Jerb. It's Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:23:33</timestamp>
<p>T-shirt's say Jerb
so I'm going by the t-shirts.
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>You know, Herb would probably think
that this is pretty funny
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>-that you couldn't even get this right.
-Yeah. He would.
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>-So, in a way...
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
