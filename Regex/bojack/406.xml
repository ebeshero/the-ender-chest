<p>If it isn't my favorite client,
Courtney Portnoy,
and also another client, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:04:27</timestamp>
<p>It's always nice to be included
in a sentence someone says.
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>So bad news first: <i>Ms. Taken</i>
was a miserable failure.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>-Princess Carolyn--
-But Courtney, more importantly,
audiences are going to adore
your tour de force performance
as the forceful denim-clad court reporter
in <i>The Court Reporter Sported Jorts,</i>
the jet-setting jort-sporting
court reporter story.
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>Yes, the film is spectacularly romantic
and well-titled,
but I need a change in representation.
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>No! Courtney! Before you fire me--
</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna fire you.
Heavens, no! I fired my agents.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>Oh, good. Yeah, agents are replaceable.
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>A manager is forever.
That's the takeaway here.
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>I think you'll fall in love
with my new agent.
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>-Love her already. Who is she?
-He.
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p>Yes, he, he, ha, ha.
<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>-Now tell me her name.
-Rutabaga Rabitowitz.
</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p>Oh, fish.
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We got a nice bounce
off of Court's engagement.
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"Court" is what I'm calling Courtney
for wordplay-related reasons
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}that'll become apparent
at the end of this sentence,
but that bounce has lost its pounce,
and if we want to keep
this name in the news,
we're going to need a full-<i>court</i> press.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So what do you do after an engagement?
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}D-d-d-doy!
Wedding of the century.
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We're talking floral arrangements.
We're talking procession of elephants.
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We're talking Jaden Smith
in a <i>Clockwork Orange</i> costume,
reading a poem he wrote...
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>Does that poem rhyme? No!
What are you, crazy? Of course it doesn't.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And, uh-oh, was someone looking
for Sebastian Janikowski,
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}because here's the kicker--
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}we do the whole thing the weekend
before the movie drops. Bam!
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Weekend before the movie drops?
-Boom!
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-That's this weekend.
-Ka-zow!
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Four days from today.
-Ooh.
</p><timestamp>00:06:03</timestamp>
<p>Today? That's today!
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>Which is why it's so perfect.
No notice is the new notice.
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}This wedding is so fancy
we don't care if you have other plans.
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>-Total status move.
-You're right.
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>Being engaged is one thing,
but I'm not sure
I want to actually get married.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We can draw up a standard
Hollywoo sham-marriage contract:
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-three years, non-exclusive, huge payday.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>And I presume
you'll be arranging everything.
</p><timestamp>00:06:26</timestamp>
<p>As Courtney's agent I'm happy to help,
but I believe traditionally
it's the bride's manager
who plans the wedding.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>

<p>-Yes, you are.
-Who are you talking to?
</p><timestamp>00:06:43</timestamp>
<p>Keep it down, oaf.
You'll make the baby cry.
</p><timestamp>00:06:47</timestamp>
<p>-Baby?
-Yes, you are.
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>She kept asking where the baby was,
so I had Tina get her this doll.
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>-She's totes into it.
-Mom is "totes" into a baby?
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>Is it possible the baby
got dipped in brandy at some point?
</p><timestamp>00:06:57</timestamp>
<p>Or cigarettes, or regressive ideas
about immigrants?
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>-I think she just wanted a baby.
-Coochie-coochie-coo...
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>You shouldn't indulge her delusions.
It's not right.
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>But she seemed really down.
And you're never around anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>It was getting depressing to look at her.
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>That's why I made her this pillowcase.
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>You just put this over her head
and everything is fine.

marathon this weekend.
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>Does anyone want to come over?
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I actually have a big announcement.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>I'm marrying Courtney Portnoy
this weekend.
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>-Wow! Great, Todd. Good for you.
-That's amazing.
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>I know it's pretty wild for an asexual
to get married, but...
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>Not really. John and I are aces
and we're married.
</p><timestamp>00:07:40</timestamp>
<p>-Really?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>Our wedding was nautical-themed.
</p><timestamp>00:07:42</timestamp>
<p>Why nautical?
Is that, like, an asexual thing?
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>No, man. We just really like boats.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>Asexual just means
you're not interested in sex.
</p><timestamp>00:07:49</timestamp>
<p>Some asexuals are also a-romantic,
but others have relationships
like anyone else.
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>But involving boats?
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>I feel like you're getting really hung up
on the boats thing.
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>So, it's not weird
for an ace to get married?
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>No, if you found someone who really
accepts you for who you are, go for it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:06</timestamp>
<p>I will! I mean, I am. I mean, am I?

<p>Hey, Diane, can I get your advice
on something?
</p><timestamp>00:15:17</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, of course. I'm not doing anything.
-Um...
</p><timestamp>00:15:19</timestamp>
<p>So, I have this friend,
and his name
is Darnarius McQuimberton.
</p><timestamp>00:15:26</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah,
I think I read an article about him
in <i>Real, Not Made-Up, Person Magazine.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:15:31</timestamp>
<p>Darnarius is supposed to get married
this weekend.
</p><timestamp>00:15:34</timestamp>
<p>And it's going to be an amazing wedding,
but it's kind of based on a lie.
</p><timestamp>00:15:39</timestamp>
<p>Should he go through with it?
</p><timestamp>00:15:40</timestamp>
<p>Well, all weddings are lies, right?
Sort of.
</p><timestamp>00:15:44</timestamp>
<p>You're making this big declaration
about how you're gonna stay
with this person forever,
but you don't actually know that.
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>You're just saying it.
The whole thing is a farce.
</p><timestamp>00:15:52</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, that's true.
-But it's a lie based on truth.
</p><timestamp>00:15:56</timestamp>
<p>Like, at the center of the farce
there's this nugget
of something real and pure.
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p>And that strange beautiful something
is why you put up
with everything else, right?
</p><timestamp>00:16:06</timestamp>
<p>I guess so.
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>And sometimes it's hard to remember
that pure, shining thing
because it's been painted over
with so many arguments
and compromises and disappointments.
</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>
<p>But you have to believe
it's still down there somewhere,
even if you can't see it.
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>And maybe even the belief in it
is more important than the thing itself,
but only as long as you still believe it.
</p><timestamp>00:16:29</timestamp>
<p>-Does that make sense?
-Yeah. Thanks, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:16:32</timestamp>
<p>You've given me
and Darquimbertus McNarington
a lot to think about.

She's very sick, very frail.

<p>Do you have any idea how much shit
you throw over the side of your deck?
</p><timestamp>00:17:11</timestamp>
<p>Beer bottles, lit cigarettes,
scripts where the lead is female.
</p><timestamp>00:17:15</timestamp>

sat on that hill for a month

</p><timestamp>00:19:44</timestamp>
<p>Look, BoJack, I don't know a lot
about balancing a state budget
</p><timestamp>00:19:47</timestamp>
<p>-or how a bill becomes a law.
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:19:49</timestamp>
<p>I don't know a lot about a lot of things.
</p><timestamp>00:19:51</timestamp>
<p>But I do know this:
everybody deserves to be loved.
</p><timestamp>00:19:57</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>clinking</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:58</timestamp>
<p>So we put together an all-star wedding
and a Meryl Streep movie in one day!
</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>-You got to admit, we're a good team.
-Rutabaga...
</p><timestamp>00:20:05</timestamp>
<p>I know it wasn't always smooth sailing
for the Good Ship You and Me,
but now you've got a boyfriend
and I've got a family,
and since we have to work together again,
we're a good team.
</p><timestamp>00:20:14</timestamp>
<p>Tell me you didn't miss this.
</p><timestamp>00:20:16</timestamp>
<p>-Todd is on line two.
-Aaah! Do you go <i>through </i>the walls?
</p><timestamp>00:20:19</timestamp>
<p>Todd! Have you finished
your groomsmen list?
</p><timestamp>00:20:21</timestamp>
<p>We gotta figure out
how many parachutes we need.
</p><timestamp>00:20:23</timestamp>
<p>Uh, guys, I-- I can't marry Courtney.
</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-No!
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>I've been doing some thinking,
and marriage is like a Tootsie Pop.
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>The lollipop part is a lie,
</p><timestamp>00:20:35</timestamp>
<p><i>but at the center of the lie</i>
<i>there's a truth.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:37</timestamp>
<p>That's the Tootsie Roll,
and that's why people get married.
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>But if I married Courtney
it would be a lie without any truth in it,
like a Tootsie Pop
with just the lollipop part
and nothing in the middle.
</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>So, a lollipop? That's still pretty good.
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Todd</subtitle> <i>I guess it's a bad analogy.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>But I don't want a fake marriage.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry I didn't realize that before.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Okay, Todd.
You gotta do what's right for you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p><i>Thanks, Princess Carolyn.</i>
<i>Whoa--</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>All right, blue sky time. Wedding's off.
Can we spin this somehow?
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>Courtney got jilted,
play the sympathy card?
</p><timestamp>00:21:13</timestamp>
<p>I guess we could put out a statement.
</p><timestamp>00:21:15</timestamp>
<p>That's your solution?
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>What happened to the guy
from this morning with all the big ideas?
</p><timestamp>00:21:18</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that guy dies at six.
This guy's gotta get home.
</p><timestamp>00:21:21</timestamp>
<p>I got seven kids and a wife
who's really into me co-parenting,
or, as she calls it, "parenting."
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p>Well, can't you tuck the kids into bed,
read them some script coverage
of the film adaptation of <i>Good Night Moon</i>
and then come back?
</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>-This is important.
-Well, my kids are important.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>Fine, both things are equally important.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, thank God you're not a mother.
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>You would be hilarious at it.
<subtitle>sips</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>Hey, today was fun.
I'll call you in the morning.
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>We'll figure this out. We'll deal with it.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>door opens</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>If you'd like to never see him again,
I have ways of getting rid of him.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>What kind of ways?
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>Asking him politely to not come back.
Actually, that's only one way.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>I apologize for misleading you
about the number of ways.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>He's a jerk, right? It's not just me?
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>I worked with guys like him at F.M.E.
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>When I left, I swore
I would never work at a big agency again,
because I can't work
with people like that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>You don't think I'm like that?
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>No, because you care about people
other than yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>And for what it's worth,
you will be a wonderful mother.
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>-You're not just saying that?
-I never just say anything.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>I choose words very carefully,
with an eye towards precision
and expediency.
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>I'm surprised you haven't noticed that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:23</timestamp>
<p>-Good night, Judah.

<p>Where do you go,
when you disappear all day?
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>Just drive around.
Sometimes I go to a bar.
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>Sometimes I pull over
by the side of the road,
just sit there for hours.
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>Why?
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>And you'd rather do that
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>-than spend time with me?
-Hollyhock...
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>I know you didn't ask
for this dorky 17-year-old
to just show up at your door.
</p><timestamp>00:23:53</timestamp>
<p>And I'm sorry if I'm annoying,
but I didn't ask...
</p><timestamp>00:23:55</timestamp>
<p>-No, Hollyhock, I'm glad you're here.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>If I'm shitty,
that's just because I'm shitty.
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>You're allowed to be mad at me,
but you need to know that whatever I do,
it's not your fault.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>I know. I mean, I know,
but I don't always know, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice
in the back of my head that goes, like,
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>"Hey, everyone hates you!
And they're not wrong to feel that way!"
</p><timestamp>00:24:19</timestamp>
<p>I know what you mean.
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>That voice, the one that tells you
you're worthless and stupid and ugly?
</p><timestamp>00:24:25</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah?
-It goes away, right?
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p>It's just, like, a dumb teenage-girl
thing, but then it goes away?
</p><timestamp>00:24:33</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
