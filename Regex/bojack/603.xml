<p>Crooshness is hard to define,
but I also don't know it when I see it.
</p><timestamp>00:00:12</timestamp>
<p>Oop. Pardon my reach.
</p><timestamp>00:00:13</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm always trying to get more girls
interested in agriculture.
</p><timestamp>00:00:16</timestamp>
<p>You might say I've got my eyes on them.
Potato eyes, that is.

<p>Hey, girls! It's Diane,

<p>-Starch Farms.
-Hello!
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>Let me get this straight.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>Your farm harvests five types of potatoes,
two types of onions,
and is also a front
for a local sex trafficking ring?

<p>No, the mayor
didn't target that neighborhood,
he was just that stupid
when it came to water filtration.

<p>He was just stupid enough to think
he wouldn't get caught, ergo--

</p><timestamp>00:02:04</timestamp>
<p>What are we supposed to do
with just one bed?
</p><timestamp>00:02:06</timestamp>
<p>Quite a pickle.
</p><timestamp>00:02:08</timestamp>
<p>I should march right back down

</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>Diane, I love
that you still eat sandwiches.

<p>Flaws like that are what make you

-Meanwhile,
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>I am adoring your cross-country exposition
of the ugly underbelly
of American capitalism.
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So croosh.
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But I wonder if you could make room
in the rotation
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}for a few feel-good stories?
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>Stefani, our videos
are making a difference.
</p><timestamp>00:05:23</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, a difference in how bummed I am.
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>There's gotta be some good news out there.

<p>-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
-We'll see what we can do!
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>-Why'd you say yes?
-We can do feel-good stories.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>What about that girl who opened up
a lemonade stand
to pay for her dad's cancer treatment?
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>How is that a feel-good story?
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>"Hey, America! We're the only developed
nation without subsidized healthcare,
so this child joined
the workforce in a desperate bid
to keep her father alive!"
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>Okay. How 'bout this?
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Local cameraman has a pretty
good thing going,
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}where he gets to travel
all over the country
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and fool around in hotel rooms with
his beautiful, smart, feisty producer...
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and he's pretty sure
this passionate, intelligent,
warrior for truth likes it too,
so maybe these two knuckleheads
should swallow their pride for a second
and make some feel-good videos.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>Hey, girls.
</p><timestamp>00:06:10</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, Diane.
-Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>Tell me
about the Every Animal Girl Company.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>We are two best friends
who got tired of seeing dolls
promoting unrealistic beauty standards.
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>Take Ginny here.
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p>Most giraffe dolls have necks
one inch shorter by scale
than the average girl giraffe.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>Not our Ginny.
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>Her neck is long and proud,
for all our necky gals out there.
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p>As a necky gal, I love that.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>And is it true that all your dolls
are made out of recycled material?
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>-Uh... No.
-Yes!
</p><timestamp>00:06:36</timestamp>
<p>-Sorry?
-Well, traditionally...
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>overlapping dialogue</subtitle>
-The first batch, um...
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>The important thing is
we're two best friends.
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>Okay, what's going on?
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>Uh... <subtitle>giggles nervously</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:47</timestamp>
<p>Okay. We are excited to announce
that as of today,
the Every Animal Girl Company
has been purchased by Toys Galore,
a subsidiary
of Whitewhale Consolidated Interests.
</p><timestamp>00:06:57</timestamp>
<p>Yay! Toys Galore!
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>"Yay..."
</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p>A small, independent start-up
bought out by a huge conglomerate.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>It must be so empowering
to see your success grow.
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>What a happy story for two best friends.
Now, about the recycled materials?
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>Well, it's unclear what role recycling
will play in the future of this company.
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>Right now, we're mainly focused
on empowering young girls
and closing the main Chicago factory
so we can relocate overseas
for cheaper labor.
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>Right before the holidays!

empowering time for you!
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>I know.
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p>You think you can edit that down
into something feel-goody?
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>For sure.
It'll have to go up late, though,
because I'm having some friends over
to watch the game tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:07:42</timestamp>
<p>God, I'm freezing.
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>-Aw.
-So, you, uh...
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>-You wanna watch the game with us?
-Are you asking me to meet your friends?
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>No, I just figure,
since you're staying with me anyway--
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>I would be delighted. Wait, it's not
the Chicago Baby Humans game, is it?

<p>Diane, this is Isabel,
star reporter at <i>The Tribune.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:14:45</timestamp>
<p>She's been hunting Whitewhale for years.
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>-Call me... Isabel.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:14:52</timestamp>
<p>All my days, the beast has haunted me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>The hunt consumes my every waking moment.
</p><timestamp>00:14:57</timestamp>
<p>You might even say Whitewhale is my...
green light at the end of the dock.
</p><timestamp>00:15:03</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-That's a <i>Gatsby</i> reference. Read a book.
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>Isabel, be nice.
</p><timestamp>00:15:07</timestamp>
<p>I wish I had the energy,
but my obsession has ruined me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:10</timestamp>
<p>Destroyed my relationships,
obliterated my career. And for nothing.
</p><timestamp>00:15:14</timestamp>
<p>I had one contact on the warehouse floor,
Matt Minnowman.
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p>-Hmm.
-Then he disappeared.
</p><timestamp>00:15:20</timestamp>
<p>-Maybe there's your story.
-Not your story?
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>
<p>Mm. My editor thought I was getting
"too invested" in the Whitewhale beat,
so he moved me
to the Holiday Gift Guide desk.
</p><timestamp>00:15:28</timestamp>
<p>Now the search for the season's hot toy
torments my waking days.

</p><timestamp>00:20:22</timestamp>
<p>Oh, him, sure!
But that was no accident. I killed him.
</p><timestamp>00:20:25</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-I murdered him!
</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>
<p>Like <i>murdered</i> murdered him?
</p><timestamp>00:20:29</timestamp>
<p>Well, I didn't murder-of-crows him.
</p><timestamp>00:20:31</timestamp>
<p>He took too many bathroom breaks
and encouraged the other employees
to take bathroom breaks as well.
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>And you're not worried it's going
to get out that you killed an employee?
</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>Like in the video
we're shooting right now?
</p><timestamp>00:20:42</timestamp>
<p>Didn't you hear? Congress just passed
a bill legalizing murder if you're rich.
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>-No, they didn't-- Oh, my God, they did!
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>Hold on. Just because it passed
the House doesn't mean the Senate will--
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>
<p>Really, Diane?
</p><timestamp>00:20:53</timestamp>
<p>Okay, but the president could still veto--
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>Really, Diane?
</p><timestamp>00:20:56</timestamp>
<p>All right, sure, but the Supreme Court.
Okay, I get it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>Look, don't take it so hard.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>If you wanna do something about it,
just make a billion dollars and murder me!

</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>Well, we can still post the video.
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>Why?
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, right, well, um, safe travels.
It's been real.
</p><timestamp>00:21:27</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. It's been real.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna beg you to stay
if that's what you're waiting for.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm not waiting for anything.
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p>I'm not that guy who says, "Diane,
please don't go, I'm in love with you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>Stay here in Chicago
and write your book of essays
and come with me to baseball games.
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>They've got a pretty good theater scene
here and a big shiny bean and you could...
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>You could be so happy
in your warm winter coat."
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>-I don't need you to say--
-I'm not gonna be that guy, all right?
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>But if you wanted to stay, I could
make things so good for you, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>-Listen--
-No, no, I get it.
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>No, listen. Guy.
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>I feel so shitty all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>I feel like the whole world is pushing in
on me, except for when I'm with you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>You have been such a good thing for me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>But I can't be with you
if you're the only good thing in my life.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>It's too much pressure. I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>-Diane! Don't get on that train!
-<subtitle>scoffs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>-Guy, I just told you--
-I know, but you're going to the airport.
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>That train's going to Cottage Grove,
you're gonna get screwed!
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no.

<p>{\an8}<subtitle>BoJack's voice</subtitle> <i>Dear Diane,</i>
<i>it was Beverly's last day yesterday.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>Everyone is real excited for her,</i>
<i>but she spent the whole day sulking</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p><i>because she never found out</i>
<i>who her secret admirer was.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p><i>Frankly, it was getting pretty annoying,</i>
<i>so finally I just say,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p><i>"It was me! I'm in love with you!"</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p><i>And she goes,</i>
<i>"Oh. I was hoping it was Mario."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p><i>And then she starts crying.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p><i>And everyone looks at me like, "Way to go,</i>
<i>you made Beverly cry on her last day."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p><i>So, the thing I keep thinking about is...</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p><i>was it worth it for Beverly to be happy</i>
<i>for a little bit,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p><i>even though it ended up sad?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p><i>Or would it have been better</i>
<i>if the whole thing never happened?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p><i>Every time someone leaves rehab...</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p><i>it makes you think</i>
<i>about your own progress.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:23</timestamp>
<p><i>Some days it feels like you're not</i>
<i>progressing at all, other days you think,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:26</timestamp>
<p><i>"Well, maybe a little."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>
<p><i>The main thing I think about</i>
<i>is how stupid I am</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p><i>that I didn't do this sooner.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p><i>I wasted so many years being miserable</i>
<i>because I assumed</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p><i>that was the only way to be.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p><i>But I don't wanna do that anymore.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p><i>Also, am I crazy or have I gotten</i>
<i>really good at writing letters?</i>

<p>-Hey.
-Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:23:53</timestamp>
<p>I was thinking about these grilled cheese
sandwiches I used to make,
back when I first moved to LA.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-I was dirt-broke,
and I had no friends and no job,
and I got obsessed with perfecting
the art of the grilled cheese sandwich.
</p><timestamp>00:24:05</timestamp>
<p>-Makes sense.
-Partly because it was cheap,
but also because while I was doing it,
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p>I wasn't thinking about how depressing
my life was.
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:24:13</timestamp>
<p>So, on the plane I was thinking,
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>I should make
another grilled cheese sandwich
because I haven't in a long time,
but I love them
and they always make me feel better
about things.
</p><timestamp>00:24:24</timestamp>
<p>-Look, Diane, I gotta--
-And the thing about
making your own grilled cheese sandwich
is you can do it anywhere. You know?
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:24:33</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
So, I guess that's another good thing.
