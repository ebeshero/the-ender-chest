<p>-I know, I know.
-I'm just glad you showed up.
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>The waitstaff was starting
to get suspicious.
</p><timestamp>00:00:16</timestamp>
<p>See? I'm not a liar! I do have a wife!
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>-All right. You're trying to embarrass me.
-And I did. And now I'm fine.
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>-Hi, you.
-Hi, you. <subtitle>kisses</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>Long day at the office?
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>-I lost them, Indira.
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>In all my years of corporate mediation,
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>I've never been unable to resolve
a dispute before it goes to arbitration.
</p><timestamp>00:00:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm Mary-Beth, the Mediating Maven.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure you helped them
in ways you'll never even know.
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>-I-- Don't therapize me.
-<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> But you're so easy!
</p><timestamp>00:00:42</timestamp>
<p>You make me feel like
I'm actually good at it.
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>What's going on with you?
</p><timestamp>00:00:45</timestamp>
<p>-It's been a tough week.
-Tell me.
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>Mm...
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p>-I shouldn't talk about my clients.
-Come on.
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>What if you changed all the names
and identifying characteristics?
</p><timestamp>00:00:54</timestamp>
<p>Okay. This is a story about...
</p><timestamp>00:00:57</timestamp>
<p>Bo... Bo... BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.

</p><timestamp>00:01:59</timestamp>
<p><i>I was in a session with Diane--</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:01</timestamp>
<p><i>...a! Diana.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Mary-Beth</subtitle> <i>Like Diana,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:02:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Indira</subtitle> <i>Exactly.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:06</timestamp>
<p>It's just so tough
being Princess of Whales.
</p><timestamp>00:02:08</timestamp>
<p>Like, I can't be all things to all whales.
</p><timestamp>00:02:10</timestamp>
<p>-You're deflecting.
-I'm not!
</p><timestamp>00:02:11</timestamp>
<p>Let's talk about the BoBo tape.
</p><timestamp>00:02:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What's the BoBo tape?
</p><timestamp>00:02:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}She recently came into possession
of an audiotape
</p><timestamp>00:02:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}of her friend and co-worker,
BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.
</p><timestamp>00:02:20</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoBo</subtitle> <i>On the boat. There was a girl.</i>
<i>In New Mexico.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>And she trusted me. Also, I'm a zebra.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What girl is he talking about?
-I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:02:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"Girl" sounds young, right? <subtitle>scoffs</subtitle>
Whatever it is, it's gotta be bad,
</p><timestamp>00:02:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}because, otherwise,
why wouldn't he tell me?
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Diana, you are not responsible
for the dysfunction of others.
</p><timestamp>00:02:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I actually explore this in my book,
</p><timestamp>00:02:43</timestamp>
<p><i>Are You Responsible</i>
<i>For The Dysfunction of Others?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>Spoiler alert: You're not!
</p><timestamp>00:02:46</timestamp>
<p>I just wish I could talk to him about it,
but he's like an open sore.
</p><timestamp>00:02:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Attention! As some of you
might have heard, my mom died recently.
</p><timestamp>00:02:54</timestamp>
<p>I know you're very concerned,
but I wanna let you know
it will not affect my work.
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>I'm here, and I'm doing fine.
I just want to focus on the show.
</p><timestamp>00:03:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So, please treat this like any other day,
and be extra-nice to me
</p><timestamp>00:03:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}because I am a famous actor,
not because my mom died.
</p><timestamp>00:03:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>all murmuring</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:10</timestamp>
<p>Thank you. Good.
</p><timestamp>00:03:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yes, that's what I'm looking for.
Just go about your business.
</p><timestamp>00:03:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's good 'cause I don't want to talk
about my mom.
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>Hmm. <subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>-Hey. Did you hear my mom died?
-Yeah. But you don't wanna talk about it.
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>No. Pretty weird she died, though, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>-Do you want to talk about it?
-No. I'm just saying it's weird.
</p><timestamp>00:03:28</timestamp>
<p>-BoBo. I am so sorry.
-And I so don't wanna talk about it.
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>Obsessed with my mom much?
You're the one with issues.
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I feel like he wants me to comfort him,
but I'm still angry.
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Maybe you could both use some space
from each other.
</p><timestamp>00:03:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Why don't you tell him you need
to focus on your work?
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What work?
Flippy won't let me do anything.
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>dolphin voice</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>Flippy? Are you okay?
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>squeaking</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:57</timestamp>
<p>Hey, what are we filming today?
Why is there a submarine set?
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>squeaking continues</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diana</subtitle> Interior sub?
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Why didn't you just write "way"?
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>Okay. So, now we just need
to come up with a scene
that takes place in a submarine.
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:04:25</timestamp>
<p>-Ah!
-Did you hear my mom died?
</p><timestamp>00:04:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Indira</subtitle> How about this?
If he wants to talk,
and you aren't can't confront him,
tell him your<i> therapist</i> says
you need space.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>That's where I went wrong.
I inserted myself into her story.
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>Don't beat yourself up.
Remember what Doctor Janet said?
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>bells in accordance to stick</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>Tell me about your day.
You had a tough workplace mediation?
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>Whoo! The problem with these two
is they don't just work together.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>They also live together.
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>What a beautiful morning!
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Indira</subtitle> Wait, wait,, wait. Hold on.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>If your story can have Princess Diana,
why can't mine have Emperor Finger-Face?
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>It's not actually Princess Diana.
She's just named Diana.
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>I've been picturing Princess Diana.
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>Okay, fine. Tell me what happened
with Emperor Finger-Face.
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>He lived in the same apartment
as a Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning
in the shape of a woman.
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>Good morning, Emperor Finger-Face!
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>Good morning to you,
Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning!
</p><timestamp>00:05:24</timestamp>
<p>-See you tonight?
-Afternoon.
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>I wanna talk to you,
so I set a meeting through your assistant.
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>-Have you seen my keys?
-Butter tray in the fridge.
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>I think I put them there
during one of my night terrors.
</p><timestamp>00:05:34</timestamp>
<p>I don't have time to go to the kitchen.
I'll just hotwire my car.
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, did you eat breakfast?
-No time for meals.
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>I just grab whatever I can,
whenever I can.
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p>Hold on.
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>I know you're a gal on the go,
but even tangled fogs of pulsating
yearning need to eat right.
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>I'll get something on set.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>Pinky swear? <subtitle>horn</subtitle> Ow! I poked my face!
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>I feel I'm having a hard time
following the story
because of how weird
you made the characters.
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>The important thing is that these two
have been living together
for almost a year with virtually no drama.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>In some ways, it's the most functional
relationship either have ever been in!
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>Oh, okay. I guess that's not that weird.
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>Great! Now, back to the story
of the fog and the hand!
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>-So. What can I do you for?
-I have no workspace on set.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>I was hoping we could allocate some money
to get me an office.
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>Oh, look, here's the exact paperwork
you need all filled out and ready to go.
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-Just needs your signature.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>-Let me retrieve my pen.
-Marvelous!
</p><timestamp>00:06:26</timestamp>
<p>Yep, I am currently gripping my pen
inside my jacket.
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p>Now to just pull it out
and sign this document.
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>Just goes to show,
you get what you need
if you pull the right strings.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>Strings?
</p><timestamp>00:06:39</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle> It was you!
-What was me?
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>The last string cheese in the apartment,
I was saving it. And you took it!
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>And now you want me to give you an office?
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>What?! I didn't take your cheese.
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>Uh-oh, are we having
a work-related conflict?
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p>This feels like more of a
you-crashing-on-my-couch-related conflict.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>When I started here,
I signed a contract that said,
all intra-office disputes
must be resolved via mediation,
or failing that, forced arbitration.
</p><timestamp>00:07:09</timestamp>
<p>Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>So, then I-- You're not eating.
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>I just-- I keep thinking
about BoBo the Zebra.
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>Okay, what happened next with BoBo?
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>Well, he wanted to get back to work,
but since Flippy had writer's block,
there was nothing for the actors to do.
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>How is there nothing to shoot?
</p><timestamp>00:07:24</timestamp>
<p>So, what, I just have to wait around,
and be alone with my thoughts? Gross.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>When I was on<i> The Murder-Stoppers.</i>
we had to shut down production
because Nick Nolte wouldn't come out
of his trailer.
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>He wasn't even on the show!
He was in one of our trailers,
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p>-and we couldn't get him out!
-Is it hard to write a script, Gino?
</p><timestamp>00:07:38</timestamp>
<p>"Oh, I'm Philbert, bang, bang.
I'm a tough guy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:40</timestamp>
<p>My wife is dead! Did I kill her?
Who knows? I'm cool."
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>That was pretty good.
Can we just roll on that?
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>When there's something to shoot,
we'll shoot.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>Meanwhile, you wanna go bang one out
in your trailer? I'll get my diaphragm.
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>Nah, I'd just be thinking about
my dead mom the whole time,
which would either ruin it or--
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God, what if it makes it better?
I don't wanna know that.
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>-You want me to just get you some pie?
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>-Yes.
-Okay, big guy.
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoBo sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>sympathetic voice</subtitle> Hey, buddy.
-Hey, Mr. Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread.
</p><timestamp>00:08:05</timestamp>
<p>Really sorry about your mom.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>No, it's fine. I'm fine. It's really fine.
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>It must be so hard to lose a loved one.
I, for one, never have.
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>You've never lost a loved one?
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>-When my mom got old, she moved to a farm.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>In the country, where she could have
plenty of room to run free.
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>Why would she wanna run around
if she's old?
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>You know,
I never really questioned the logic.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>My brother set it up.
I haven't been able to visit,
but everyone in my family
goes to that farm eventually.
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, dude, your mom's dead.
-What? No. She's at a farm.
</p><timestamp>00:08:32</timestamp>
<p>After a prolonged bout of Parkinson's.
A farm.
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>Where they don't have telephones,
or the internet, and... Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p>She's dead. My mom is dead!
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>sobbing</subtitle>
-Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:08:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoBo groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>Oh, there... There, there.
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Flippy squeaking</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>
<p>-What's going on with this submarine?
-My therapist doesn't want me
talking to you!
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-My therapist, Dr. Indira,
says it would be good
if you gave me some space.
</p><timestamp>00:08:53</timestamp>
<p>-Why would she say that?
-Don't know. I'm just the client.
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>-Her call, not mine. I should go.
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>Everybody? My dear mother
has transcended this plane.
</p><timestamp>00:09:02</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all</subtitle> Aw.
-I am incredibly fragile
and could use all the support I can get,
so if everyone could pay
a lot of attention to me,
and ask me a lot of questions
about my mother,
and maybe tell me stories
about your mothers,
</p><timestamp>00:09:12</timestamp>
<p>I think that would really make me
feel a lot better.
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p>Sure, Mr. Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread!
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>man</subtitle> So sorry for your loss.
-This is a very healthy way to grieve.
</p><timestamp>00:09:19</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>applause</subtitle>
-Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>So, a brief recapitulation:
this is not a room
for repudiation or condemnation
over string cheese
appropriation accusations.
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>Mediation is an invitation
for open conversation,
frustration de-escalation,
and exchange of information,
which, in summation,
removes any justification for litigation
involving this corporation.
</p><timestamp>00:09:43</timestamp>
<p>Nobody was going to litigate anything.
</p><timestamp>00:09:45</timestamp>
<p>That's fabulous,
because you legally cannot.
</p><timestamp>00:09:48</timestamp>
<p>Now, tell me about your journey
into the woods of conflict.
</p><timestamp>00:09:51</timestamp>
<p>Well, this very Wednesday, October 24th,
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>I was excited to come home
to some string cheese. The very last one.
</p><timestamp>00:09:59</timestamp>
<p>I'd been saving it all week.
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>-All week until Wednesday?
-That is correct.
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>I measure my weeks Thursday to Wednesday.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>-Why would you--
-Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning?
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>Emperor Finger-Face has the floor.
</p><timestamp>00:10:10</timestamp>
<p>I was gonna melt it down
and then sculpt it
into a Mozzarella Cinderella!
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>But when I got home,
my string cheese was gone!
</p><timestamp>00:10:18</timestamp>
<p>Doesn't mean I took it.
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>Tangled Fog, watch yourself.
Or I'll turn on this fan.
</p><timestamp>00:10:21</timestamp>
<p>Well, this morning you said yourself
that when it comes to eating,
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>-you just grab whatever you can.
-Can we use "I" statements?
</p><timestamp>00:10:29</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>shouts</subtitle> Ai, ai, ai! You took my cheese!
</p><timestamp>00:10:31</timestamp>
<p>You probably ate it yourself
during one of your night terrors!
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>We know you opened the fridge.
You put my keys in there.
</p><timestamp>00:10:36</timestamp>
<p>I can't eat while I'm terrified.
</p><timestamp>00:10:38</timestamp>
<p>That's why I'll never know
the delicious crunch of Count Chocula.
</p><timestamp>00:10:42</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>shudders</subtitle>
-That still doesn't mean I took it.
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>-You will both have a chance to--
-Come on!
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>We both know you drift around
the apartment like you own the place.
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>-It's my apartment!

<p>-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle> Who do you think you are?
-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle> Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:10:58</timestamp>
<p>-I'm Dr. Indir--
-I know who you are!
</p><timestamp>00:11:00</timestamp>
<p>You know how many therapists
there are named Indira?
</p><timestamp>00:11:02</timestamp>
<p>Google filled in your last name for me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:05</timestamp>
<p>Why did you tell Diana
that she needed space from me?
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>Would you like to have a seat?
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>No, I don't wanna "have a seat,"
and here's why.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>Therapists are manipulative leeches...
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p>So, when Jerry Lewis
mistook me for the valet,
he was carrying so much pain
I could never fathom.
</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>
<p>-Mm...
-And that realization
allows me to forgive.
Not for his sake, but for mine.
</p><timestamp>00:11:28</timestamp>
<p>-Mm-hmm.
-Wow. How long was I talking?
</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>I hope that was cathartic for you.
You wanna come back same time tomorrow?
</p><timestamp>00:11:33</timestamp>
<p>Wait a minute, I see what's going on here.
Are you... my new best friend?
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Uh...?
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>Ugh, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm hogging
all the conversation.
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>There's definitely more to your story
than mine.
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>Mine's more like a secondary story.
A B-story, if you will.
</p><timestamp>00:11:50</timestamp>
<p>I have a feeling it will continue
to offer a light alternative,
as my story gets increasingly serious.
</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>Let's continue to switch back and forth
between our stories,
pausing at their most interesting moments.
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>That feels like the most natural way
to have a conversation.
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>Well, while I was talking to BoBo,
</p><timestamp>00:12:04</timestamp>
<p>Diana was trying to keep things together
</p><timestamp>00:12:06</timestamp>
<p>-on set.
-I thought it was my turn.
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle> Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
-<subtitle>Diana</subtitle> Okay, cut?
</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>buzzer blares</subtitle>
-Why is Sassy saying "Oh, my God?"
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>I just figured,
we've got all these people here,
we might as well film some stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p>Presumably something shocking will happen,
and then if it does,
we have a shot of you saying,
<subtitle>mimics Gino</subtitle> "Oh, my God!"
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p>-Makes sense.
-Diana, can I talk to you for a sec?
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>I know you're going through something,
and need boundaries,
but this isn't personal,
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>-it's about the show.
-Ah!
</p><timestamp>00:12:30</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diana grunts, sighs</subtitle> What is it?
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>I lied. It's a 100% personal.
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-But it's good! You're gonna like this.
</p><timestamp>00:12:35</timestamp>
<p>-Remember you said you needed space?
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>When you told me that,
I didn't take it well.
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-But I made a new friend,
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>-so everything is good now.
-Oh. Well, that's great.
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>I'm glad you think so because, fun twist,
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>-it's Dr. Indira.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>I'm seeing Dr. Indira now, as a friend.
Dr. Indira's my new friend.
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>It's great that you would wanna talk
to someone, and you should!
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>But she's mine.
I really need her to just be mine.
</p><timestamp>00:12:56</timestamp>
<p>-Can you understand that?
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>Diana asked me not to be friends with you,
so out of respect for her,
</p><timestamp>00:13:05</timestamp>
<p>I think it's best that I continue
seeing you behind her back.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>We can still do our lunchtime hang outs,
but to cover our tracks,
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>I'll compensate you
for your time on the books.
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>Ιt'll seem as if you have a client.
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>And, to be safe, we should invoke
a therapist-to-friend confidentiality.
</p><timestamp>00:13:19</timestamp>
<p>How's that sound?
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>So, in my dreams, I'm Philbert,
and sometimes when I wake up,
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>I don't know if I'm Philbert or if I'm me,
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>-or if I'm still dreaming.
-<subtitle>watch beeping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:30</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's our time of friendship hour.
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm just so glad that I can help break up
your day of listening to whiny babies
with some entertaining lunchtime convo.
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>Should I have told him
what we were doing was therapy?
</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>
<p>On some level, he must have known
what was going on.
</p><timestamp>00:13:44</timestamp>
<p>What I don't understand is,
if you knew Diana asked him
not to see you--
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>I'm a therapist. A doctor heals.
A DJ spins.
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>Jessica Chastain takes whatever gig
Amy Adams says no to.
</p><timestamp>00:13:54</timestamp>
<p>My job is to listen.
</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>And at that moment,
BoBo needed someone to listen.
</p><timestamp>00:13:58</timestamp>
<p>I know the feeling.
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>Okay, we've been going back and forth
for two hours.
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>Can we take a break?
I gotta use the bathroom. If I even can!
</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p>Maybe it's just another hand down there!
Guess I'll find out!
</p><timestamp>00:14:10</timestamp>
<p>Why not just say you took the cheese?
</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p>-Because I didn't.
-You want an office, right?
</p><timestamp>00:14:14</timestamp>
<p>There's nothing wrong with telling
a small lie to avoid a fight.
</p><timestamp>00:14:18</timestamp>
<p>I do it all the time with my wife,
Doctor, uh, Underwear.
</p><timestamp>00:14:22</timestamp>
<p>-Heh?
-I love your new hairstyle, honey.
</p><timestamp>00:14:25</timestamp>
<p>-Did you not like my new hairstyle?
-Oh! Um... Back to my story...
</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p>All you have to do
is tell Emperor Finger-Face
what he wants to hear.
</p><timestamp>00:14:34</timestamp>
<p>Fifty-nine cents worth of edible string
for a brand-new office?
</p><timestamp>00:14:37</timestamp>
<p>Wouldn't you take that deal?
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>So, turns out I can use the bathroom,
but it comes out in tiny cubes!
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>Hey. I took the string cheese.
</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>Ha, ha! I knew it!
</p><timestamp>00:14:48</timestamp>
<p>Wonderful. So, she can replace the cheese
and you'll give her an office. We did it!
</p><timestamp>00:14:52</timestamp>
<p>Great! Let me just grab my pen.
</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>-But even if I did take the cheese--
-Which you just admitted you did!
</p><timestamp>00:14:59</timestamp>
<p>Would I be in the wrong?
</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>I mean, it is kind of a "fair game food,"
don't you think?
</p><timestamp>00:15:03</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-It's not like it's a sandwich.
</p><timestamp>00:15:05</timestamp>
<p>Some foods are just widely understood
to be up for grabs.
</p><timestamp>00:15:07</timestamp>
<p>-No. You guys.
-<subtitle>Finger-Face</subtitle> Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:15:09</timestamp>
<p>Well, then let's make a list
of fair game foods.
</p><timestamp>00:15:12</timestamp>
<p>Grapes. Fair game. Eggs. Fair game.
An unsliced pie. Not fair game.
</p><timestamp>00:15:17</timestamp>
<p>A sliced pie. Fair game.
The last slice. Not fair game.
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>
<p>Then let's also make a list
of what's fair game to me in my apartment.
</p><timestamp>00:15:25</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's right, everything,
you literal knucklehead.
</p><timestamp>00:15:28</timestamp>
<p>Oh, ho-ho!
That's a solid diss coming from a gas.
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p>Please, you two,
we can still reach an agreement.
</p><timestamp>00:15:35</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. I think this might go
beyond simple mediation.
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>
<p>-No!
-Damn it, we're going to arbitration!

<p>If it relieves any pressure,
</p><timestamp>00:16:05</timestamp>
<p>I don't know that everyone thinks
you're a brilliant genius.
</p><timestamp>00:16:09</timestamp>
<p>I think we need to simplify.
</p><timestamp>00:16:10</timestamp>
<p>Let's start with Fritz.
Is he a ghost or is he not a ghost?
</p><timestamp>00:16:14</timestamp>
<p>Can't he just be a ghost?
</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>
<p>So, why is Philbert seeing a ghost?
Maybe he feels haunted?
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>And Fritz represents that?
What is haunting Philbert?
</p><timestamp>00:16:26</timestamp>
<p>That's great. But also...
Maybe something involving a submarine?
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p>You keep thinking.
</p><timestamp>00:16:34</timestamp>
<p>Hey, are we about to shoot something?
</p><timestamp>00:16:36</timestamp>
<p>I'm meeting a friend for lunch.
You don't know her.
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>
<p>It's gonna be a while still.
</p><timestamp>00:16:39</timestamp>
<p>Flippy is working through his "process."
And I am helping.
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>
<p>Sounds good. Just remember,
you are not responsible
for the dysfunction of others.
</p><timestamp>00:16:47</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:16:48</timestamp>
<p>I'm just saying don't let him
get you down.
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>Where did you hear that?
About the dysfunction of others?
</p><timestamp>00:16:52</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. Just around.
It's a thing people say.
</p><timestamp>00:16:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diana</subtitle> Mm...
</p><timestamp>00:16:56</timestamp>
<p>Hey, are we gonna get new pages today
or what?
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p>W-w-wait, did you say "Princess Carolyn"?
</p><timestamp>00:17:00</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, "Priscilla Crustacean."
</p><timestamp>00:17:04</timestamp>
<p><i>Vamanos,</i> on the pages, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:17:05</timestamp>
<p>I've been here all day today,
Wednesday, October 24th,
waiting for something to shoot.
<i>Andele, andele, andele!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:12</timestamp>
<p>I think your Priscilla Crustacean
is the same person
as my Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning
in the shape of a woman!
</p><timestamp>00:17:19</timestamp>
<p>And if she was on set all day
Wednesday, that means--
</p><timestamp>00:17:22</timestamp>
<p>Bu-- Hold on,
I'm getting to the juicy part.
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>As soon as I get the thing,
I don't want it anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>It feels cheap.
So, no, I wouldn't like a bottle of water.

<p>How long has he been your client?
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>-Not a client.
-Three--
</p><timestamp>00:17:38</timestamp>
<p>Days. Friends for three days.
</p><timestamp>00:17:40</timestamp>
<p>I asked you not to see her.
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>I asked for one part of my life
that I could have to myself.
</p><timestamp>00:17:45</timestamp>
<p>News flash, you're not the only one
going through shit.
</p><timestamp>00:17:47</timestamp>
<p>Maybe if I could talk to you,
</p><timestamp>00:17:49</timestamp>
<p>I wouldn't need to be looking
for other friends.
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>Diana, is there anything you'd like
to discuss with BoBo?
</p><timestamp>00:17:54</timestamp>
<p>We can do it right here.
This is a safe space.
</p><timestamp>00:17:56</timestamp>
<p>No. This doesn't feel
like a safe space anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:17:59</timestamp>
<p>I can't keep coming here
if I know you're also seeing him.
</p><timestamp>00:18:03</timestamp>
<p>Then it sounds like
our time together is done.
</p><timestamp>00:18:07</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:18:07</timestamp>
<p>You're setting a boundary.It is good.
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>Go forth with the tools I've given you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:11</timestamp>
<p>Live your life, Diana.
Like a candle in the wind.
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>-I can't believe this is happening.
-I think BoBo needs me more.
</p><timestamp>00:18:17</timestamp>
<p>-Would you like validation?
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>Your validation is worthless to me now.
You two deserve each other.
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:24</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you meant parking validation.
I actually would like that.
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>
<p>Wow, I can't believe you chose BoBo
over your client of seven years.
</p><timestamp>00:18:31</timestamp>
<p>At a certain point,
</p><timestamp>00:18:32</timestamp>
<p>I can't hold myself responsible
for other people's dysfunction.
</p><timestamp>00:18:35</timestamp>
<p>I mean, that is kind of your job.
</p><timestamp>00:18:38</timestamp>
<p>But at least now you can help
the Angsty Zebra, right?
</p><timestamp>00:18:40</timestamp>
<p>Well...
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>-Okay. Now for the real work to begin.
-Real what now?
</p><timestamp>00:18:45</timestamp>
<p>You did the hard part,
admitting you need help.
</p><timestamp>00:18:47</timestamp>
<p>Did I admit that?
</p><timestamp>00:18:48</timestamp>
<p>And now comes the even harder part,
getting the help.
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>-Let's talk about your mother.
-You know what? This has been great.
</p><timestamp>00:18:54</timestamp>
<p>I got what I wanted
and I made so much progress!
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>-Yes. You did it!

<p>You're focusing on the negative.

<p>I'm sure you helped them

<p>Princess Carolyn was on set all day,

<p>She was not home
when the cheese went missing,
rendering any arbitration agreement made
under those conditions null and void.
</p><timestamp>00:19:36</timestamp>
<p>Whoa! Thanks a lot, Mary-Beth.
</p><timestamp>00:19:39</timestamp>

<p>So, it sounds like
you didn't take my string cheese.
</p><timestamp>00:19:52</timestamp>
<p>That's what I've been saying!

<p>I don't even know why we had to go through
corporate mediation in the first place!
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>I guess I just wanted it to be
a workplace dispute,
because I thought if you knew
it was a roommate dispute,
you might kick me out.
</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna kick you out.
I like having you around.

</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>I was looking for someone
to hang out with during my lunch.
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>I didn't want some
psycho-babbling quack job
telling me to get in touch
with my feelings.
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>
<p>-Who needs that?
-I do. I need that.
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>You don't anymore!
She said it herself, you're fixed!
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>And then after you left, I was like,
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>"Hey, if Diane doesn't need this,
I don't need this."
</p><timestamp>00:21:01</timestamp>
<p>Wait, you quit?
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I'm not someone therapy works on.
I might be too smart.
</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God. You haven't changed at all.
</p><timestamp>00:21:07</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, whoa.
Diane, no, no. I'm not the problem here.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>None of this would have happened
if I felt like I could talk to you,
my friend, after my mother died.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>So, would you like to talk
about your mother?
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>No, I'm just saying as an example.
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>Why do you bring things back to my mother?
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>I can't keep playing this game with you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>You say you wanna get better
and you don't know how.
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p>Well, here's me, your friend,
telling you how: get therapy.
</p><timestamp>00:21:29</timestamp>
<p>Otherwise, don't waste my time.
</p><timestamp>00:21:31</timestamp>
<p>Uh, you heard Dr. Indira.
She said we don't need her.
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>She said I don't need her!
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>I know, but you're just as screwed up
as I am.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>-So, if--
-I am not as screwed up as you are.
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>Diane, it's me. Come on. We're the same.
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasps</subtitle> We are not the same!

</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p>Whoa.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>That's good stuff. We're doing it, Diane.
We're doing it!
</p><timestamp>00:21:57</timestamp>
<p>I wanna thank everyone
for being so kind this week.
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>
<p>Losing a mother is not easy,
but I am so lucky to have
the support system of my Philbert family.
</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p>You know who I really feel bad for
is my dad.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>He's out on that farm all by himself,
and-- Oh, my God. My dad is dead!
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all</subtitle> Aw.
-Cheer up, everyone!
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>-We got new pages!
-All right!
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>We're gonna film in the living room
with Philbert and Sassy Malone first.
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>We're moving into the submarine
for the flashback.
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>No time to learn lines.
We gotta make up for the lost days,
so we're gonna put the whole thing
on cue cards. Let's go!
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-All right, everybody stand back.

<p>And action!
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>Tell me what happened
in the submarine, Philbert.
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>We were doing a routine
submarine sting operation.
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>Things got outta hand.
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>-Hey. Who do you work for?
-Well, I sure as hell don't work for tips.

<p>We are in a pressurized submarine

</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>These poor guys.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>I wonder if they had kids,
families who will never know--
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>Can you just say the lines, please?
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>Barf me a river, fartbags.

</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>There was a girl there.
She couldn't have been older than 17.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>Bring in the girl!

<p>Wha--?
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>What did you do to her, Philbert?
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p>Nothing. Like I said, she kissed me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:46</timestamp>
<p>-Kiss her back.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>We need to get you kissing her back.

what would you have done with the girl?

I couldn't go through.

<p>{\an8}Malone, you gotta believe me.
I'm a good guy.

<p>If I'd known she was there,
I never would've--
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p>-Tell me what happened.

</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>-You wait right here.
-Come on, loverboy.
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>You kissed a young girl
and then left her to die.

<p>I'm a good guy.

<p>You have to understand, I'm a good guy.

<p>-She trusted you.
-How do you make something right
when you've made it so wrong,
you can never go back?
</p><timestamp>00:24:30</timestamp>
<p>How did you come up with all this?
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>It's a story I heard once.
I just changed all the names.
