<p>So I send in the form,
and if my mom wants to meet me too,
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>-then we meet?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:00:16</timestamp>
<p>And if she doesn't want to meet me,
then I get to feel that hot sting
of rejection all over again.
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>What a fun adventure this all is.
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>You know what <i>is </i>fun? You coming with me
to my first day on my new show.
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>"BoJack Horseman
in <i>F.H.B.A. Los Angeles,</i>
starring BoJack Horseman
as 'the Judge.'"
</p><timestamp>00:00:33</timestamp>
<p>What is <i>F.H.B.A.</i>?
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>I think it's one of those shows
about Navy sex crimes that have gone cold?
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>And there may be numbers or something?
Then, they call "the Judge."
</p><timestamp>00:00:42</timestamp>
<p>I'm just excited to get out of the house.
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>I've been getting really fidgety
cooped up on that hill.
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p>Like I got tiny little bumps
crawling around
on the inside of my skin, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>Totally. Look at this guy,
texting in the middle of the intersection.
</p><timestamp>00:00:54</timestamp>
<p>You have been judged
to be a shitty driver.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>I'm the Judge.
I sentence you to kiss my ass.
</p><timestamp>00:00:59</timestamp>
<p>Boom!
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>You got "judged."
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>It feels good
to be a dramatic actor again.
</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p>To make someone laugh
is a craft, to be sure,
but to make someone cry, on purpose,
that is a precious gift.
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I'm Miles, the production intern.
Can I get you anything? Water?
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>That's so sweet of you.
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>Actually, that's so his job of him.
</p><timestamp>00:01:17</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, PA, whose name I already forgot.
-It's Miles, and I'm an intern.
</p><timestamp>00:01:21</timestamp>
<p>Still not interested. Can you take
my daughter to "video village"?
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>I wanna make sure she sees me
at my most awesome,
which is with a slightly high angle
to avoid appearance of a double chin.
</p><timestamp>00:01:29</timestamp>
<p>Note to director.
</p><timestamp>00:01:30</timestamp>

<p>{\an8}Whoa, BoJack, no.
That is so degrading.
</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So if it's not about their butts,
then why is the other judge Sir Mix-A-Lot?
</p><timestamp>00:03:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Because I'm an honest and impartial judge.
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>And if there's one thing I'm famous for,
it's that I cannot lie.
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I guess that would be the one thing.
</p><timestamp>00:04:06</timestamp>
<p>Hey, can we go home now?

<p>{\an8}Being around all these skinny L.A. ladies

<p>{\an8}Well, I gotta shoot
for, like, ten more hours.
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>Are you serious?
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>Apparently, it takes three hours to set up
the "badonka-donka-dobstacle course."
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So making TV is like a full-time job?
Then why is it so bad?
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>I just assumed people weren't trying.
</p><timestamp>00:04:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Uh, I don't mean to butt in here,
but shouldn't your daughter be in school?

<p>{\an8}Shouldn't you be
"Sir Minding-Your-Own-Business-A-Lot"?
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>I graduated early and took a gap year.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>My friend Maryssa is backpacking

in this butt-infested warehouse.
</p><timestamp>00:04:40</timestamp>
<p>Oh. All right.
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>Someone better be checking
the pH levels of that Jacuzzi

</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you wanna explore the back lot?
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>They got a whole area that was built
to look like downtown Toronto.
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>That's where they shoot the stuff
set in New York.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>Are you allowed to just leave the set?
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>What are they gonna do? Dock my pay?

<p>{\an8}Princess Carolyn,
you are going to love Stilton Acres.
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We have a sauna and a tennis court
and a giant hedge maze.
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And if you make it all the way through
the maze, you get some sugar water.
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>And you're gonna love
the Feast of Saint Squeaky.
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>It's the holiest of all mouse holidays.
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>We prepare a feast of Swiss--
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>Because it's the holiest of all cheeses?
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>Because it was all our ancestors
could carry
when they were trying to escape
for their lives.
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh-- because it has <i>holes!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-That's very funny.
-Thanks.
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I really want you and my parents
to get along.
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}They can be kind of a lot,
especially around the holidays.
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm sure I'm going to love them.
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And they're gonna love me.
I'm Princess Carolyn!
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure they will too.
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>But let's wait
until after they love you
to tell them about, you know, Philbert.
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Of course. But what about her?
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Don't worry. She's on her phone.
</p><timestamp>00:05:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Unless Ralph and Princess Carolyn's
secret baby starts to trend,
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>

<p>-Mr. Peanutbutter, that's not--
-On the phone, darling.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>Well, I just found you
the perfect new campaign headquarters.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna sign the lease now,
unless you think of a reason
I shouldn't.
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p>Nothing comes to mind.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>Great! It's done.
Now, what did you wanna talk to me about?
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>-I'm dropping out of the race.
-What?!
</p><timestamp>00:06:26</timestamp>
<p>Woodchuck's a better leader
than I'll ever be.
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>This election is about bigger things
than just you and Woodchuck.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>What is it about then?
</p><timestamp>00:06:33</timestamp>
<p>It's about hope, and freedom,
and powerful lobbyists
who pay me to elect
a governor I can control
so we can get legislation passed
that allows them to build private prisons
on what are now protected wetlands.
</p><timestamp>00:06:43</timestamp>
<p>Well, hopefully those evil lobbyists
can find some other puppet
to do their bidding.
</p><timestamp>00:06:47</timestamp>
<p>Why would you hope that?
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>I'm done running for governor,
so you're fired.
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>No hard feelings, right?
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>

<p>It's so wonderful to meet you all!

<p>-Can I get you a cocktail?
-Oh. No, thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>-Wine?
-That's all right.
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>I will consider it a personal affront
if you won't at least have a beer.
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>-I shouldn't.
-What about a very caffeinated coffee?
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-Raw shellfish?
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>-Not tonight.
-Cigarette?
</p><timestamp>00:07:27</timestamp>
<p>-I don't smoke.
-That's okay.
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>You can just stand around me
while I smoke.
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>No, I don't want to.
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>Cocaine, then?
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>I so appreciate that,
and I hate to be rude,
but I really don't think it's a good idea.
</p><timestamp>00:07:36</timestamp>
<p>Would you like me to punch you
in the belly real quick
so you remember
what it's like to be alive?
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>That's a rich person thing.
</p><timestamp>00:07:42</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I know.
I grew up around rich people.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>But I'm actually good,
as far as belly-punchings go.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>Well, can I at least offer you a ride
on our private rollercoaster?
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>Surely, there's no reason
you wouldn't want to do that.
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>-So if you decline, I will be offended.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>Also, not that it's relevant,
but the rollercoaster
is specifically discouraged
for children under five
and pregnant women.
</p><timestamp>00:08:00</timestamp>
<p>But since you are neither of those,
obviously, there's no reason
you will not want to ride
on our family's really fun rollercoaster.
</p><timestamp>00:08:06</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, look, the truth is--
-Hey, Dad!
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you tell Princess Carolyn
one of your great golf stories?
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>-Say, there's an idea.
-Yes!
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>

<p>My message is simple.
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>If you want to vote Peanutbutter,
vote Coodchuck-Berkowitz
because a vote for Coodchuck-Berkowitz
is a vote for Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>Uh--
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>Since Peanutbutter
likes Coodchuck-Berkowitz.
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>So if you like Coodchuck-Berkowitz,
vote like Mr. Peanutbutter...
</p><timestamp>00:08:46</timestamp>
<p>-Excuse me--
-...for Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>So if we want to vote for Woodchuck,
we should vote for you?
</p><timestamp>00:08:53</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>-By voting for Woodchuck.
-Thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>I look forward to moving past
the political divisiveness
of this campaign
and <i>finally </i>focusing on the issues.

<p>What's with the gorilla feet?
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>

<p>As I've explained before,
my hands were crushed

<p>There were no hand transplants

find me more suitable replacements.

<p>So, what's next for us two amigos?
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter,
we don't need your help on the campaign.
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>We are running virtually unopposed.
I think our team can handle it from here.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>Wha-wha-wha-what?
</p><timestamp>00:09:45</timestamp>
<p>The best way you can help us
is to go back to your regular life
and stay out of politics forever.
</p><timestamp>00:09:51</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>Wow, look at the time.
That's enough questioning of me,
and where I've been,
and what I've been doing. See ya later!
</p><timestamp>00:10:26</timestamp>
<p>Hold up.
Did you and that PA hook up last night?
</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>
<p>BoJack! We didn't just hook up.
</p><timestamp>00:10:30</timestamp>
<p>Miles is a really interesting soul,
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>
<p>-and I feel like we connected.
-Oh, boy. Okay. Sit down.
</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>Hollyhock, you are never gonna hear
from that guy again.
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>Okay, actually, I am,
because when I left his dorm
he said he would,
and I quote, "Definitely text me."
</p><timestamp>00:10:43</timestamp>
<p>Oh, wow, I didn't realize.
</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>
<p>Should we plan the wedding for you
and teenage-boy-you-slept-with
who-said-he-would-definitely-text-you"?
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>Very funny.
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>Believe me, I take no pleasure
in telling you this,
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>-but that kid is never, ever, ever--
-<subtitle>phone chimes</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>-Ooh! BoJack--
-Hollyhock, it is very rude to interrupt.
</p><timestamp>00:10:58</timestamp>
<p>Now, where was I?
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>Right. You'll never <i>ever</i>
hear from this guy again.
</p><timestamp>00:11:03</timestamp>
<p>-But, I--
-Ba-ba-ba!
</p><timestamp>00:11:04</timestamp>
<p>In fact, if he texts you,
I will do a hundred pushups.
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>That's how sure I am,
since there is no possible way--
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>"Had a great time last night. Kilometers."
</p><timestamp>00:11:13</timestamp>
<p>"Kilometers"?
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>It's an inside joke between me and Miles.
</p><timestamp>00:11:17</timestamp>
<p>Not inside enough.
I figured it out and it's dumb.
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>phone chimes</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>

-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:25</timestamp>
<p>Nope, can't. Impossible.
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p>Anyone who says
they did a pushup is lying.

<p>-<subtitle>phone chimes</subtitle>
-That him canceling? Classic move.
</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>No, he wants to spend the day together.
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Well, you wanna
have breakfast first?
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>I got a box of crullers,
of which one remains.
</p><timestamp>00:11:36</timestamp>
<p>Nah, I'm good with this coffee.
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>I'll be home for dinner, though. Bye!
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>Forty-six, 47...
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>

<p>We have gathered in Todd's new apartment

</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p>You told me this was an intervention
to get Todd to stop coming up
with awful ideas.
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>That was a pretense
to get you to show up.
</p><timestamp>00:12:04</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-It was Todd's idea.
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>What else you got, Todd?
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>Well, I got this one thing.
I don't know. It might be pretty dumb.
</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>-You bite your tongue.
-Yes, bite it all the way off!
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>All your ideas are beyond terrible.
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>Well, in that case, I guess I must have
"terrible" business instincts.
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>-You do!
-Because I wanna hear it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:21</timestamp>
<p>They say "the devil's in the details,"
so let's summon the devil!
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so you know how hard it is
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>-to get your kids to go to the dentist?
-I don't.
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>But what if dentists
had a friendlier face?
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>What if you could take your kids
to a dentist's office
where all the dentists were clowns?
</p><timestamp>00:12:38</timestamp>
<p>-What?!
-Kids love clowns!
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>-Do kids love clowns?
-Actually--
</p><timestamp>00:12:42</timestamp>
<p>Don't they?
Who else would clowns be for?
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>Because adults don't love clowns.
</p><timestamp>00:12:47</timestamp>
<p>That is true.
Adults find clowns creepy and off-putting.
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>So kids <i>must </i>love clowns,
because otherwise,
why would there be clowns?
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>That is sound logic. Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:12:56</timestamp>
<p>I want these clown dentists
laughing maniacally
as they drill into the teeth
of America's children, starting yesterday!
</p><timestamp>00:13:02</timestamp>
<p>As someone who <i>does </i>have children,
I have to say,
a lot of kids
are actually <i>terrified </i>of clowns!
</p><timestamp>00:13:09</timestamp>
<p>Are they? Hm.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>That would have been helpful information
before I committed.
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>But my word is my bond
and I already said yes, didn't I?
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so do we find dentists
and train them to be clowns,
or do we get clowns
and train them to be dentists?
</p><timestamp>00:13:22</timestamp>
<p>Why don't we get clowns and dentists
and they can train each other?
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>Oh, somebody call the police department,
because you are <i>on fire!</i>

<p>It's been so wonderful getting

<p>We're so happy to have you.
Now, let the festivities begin.
</p><timestamp>00:13:46</timestamp>
<p>-Sissy, hand out those cat ears.
-Cat ears?
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>-And this is for you.
-I want those.
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>See, the feast is about remembering
the ancient tale of a heroic mouse
named Squeaky.
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>And we always start by wearing cat ears
and singing the song of Squeaky's enemy,
the cat tyrant, King Pusspuss.
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>Looks like Princess Carolyn
won't need any cat ears to look evil.

your family's holiday was so anti-cat.

-What are you trying to do?
</p><timestamp>00:15:23</timestamp>
<p>I'm trying to keep you out of trouble
with a showman's flair for the dramatic.
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>I texted you I was gonna be home late.
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>You don't tell me when
you're home late.
</p><timestamp>00:15:31</timestamp>
<p>This is my house.
You need to ask permission.
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p>-What? You're not my dads.
-I'm just looking out for you.
</p><timestamp>00:15:36</timestamp>
<p>You spent four days
with this kid, I'm worried--
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>
<p>There's nothing to worry about!
We like each other.
</p><timestamp>00:15:40</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, now. But come on, Hollyhock.
</p><timestamp>00:15:43</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>stammers, sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:44</timestamp>
<p>He's a teenage boy
whose job is to be around hot women
in skimpy outfits all day.
</p><timestamp>00:15:49</timestamp>
<p>You think he's gonna want--
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:15:51</timestamp>
<p>No, I just mean that...
</p><timestamp>00:15:53</timestamp>
<p>What, you think
I'm not attractive enough for him?
</p><timestamp>00:15:55</timestamp>
<p>Well, you're the one
who said you were a blob.
</p><timestamp>00:15:58</timestamp>
<p>-Do you think I'm a blob?
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:16:00</timestamp>
<p>What kind of person
calls his own daughter a blob?
</p><timestamp>00:16:03</timestamp>
<p>-You said "blob."
-I said I "felt" like a blob.
</p><timestamp>00:16:05</timestamp>
<p>Do <i>you </i>think I'm a blob?
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>I just-- <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:08</timestamp>
<p>I just think L.A. is a superficial town
and you need to be careful.
</p><timestamp>00:16:12</timestamp>
<p>Well, Miles likes me just the way I am.
</p><timestamp>00:16:15</timestamp>
<p>And that's the kind of person
that I want to spend my time with.
</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>
<p>Hollyhock, wait. Wait. Wait!
</p><timestamp>00:16:20</timestamp>
<p>I get it! It's my weight!
</p><timestamp>00:16:28</timestamp>
<p>Yeah... I'm sorry about all that.
</p><timestamp>00:16:31</timestamp>
<p>Why didn't you tell me they hate cats?
</p><timestamp>00:16:32</timestamp>
<p>They don't hate cats.
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p>Now I get why you didn't want
to tell your family about the baby.
</p><timestamp>00:16:36</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I was a little nervous.
But they'll come around.
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>
<p>Besides, what am I supposed to do?
They're my family.
</p><timestamp>00:16:42</timestamp>
<p>-And what are me and Philbert?
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>Can't believe she's still pissed.
</p><timestamp>00:16:51</timestamp>
<p>You shouldn't have called her a "blob."
</p><timestamp>00:16:53</timestamp>
<p>I'm a blob too! We're both blobs!
</p><timestamp>00:16:56</timestamp>
<p>How about just as a general rule,
don't ever call a woman a blob?
</p><timestamp>00:16:59</timestamp>
<p>Never! What if I meet a woman
whose name is Barbara Lob?
</p><timestamp>00:17:03</timestamp>
<p>And I call her "B" for short. "B. Lob."
</p><timestamp>00:17:05</timestamp>
<p>Maybe instead of figuring out
the woman blob workaround,
you should just tell Hollyhock
you're sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:17:10</timestamp>
<p>I still think Miles is up to something.
</p><timestamp>00:17:12</timestamp>
<p>Why is it so hard for you to believe
someone could genuinely
like your daughter?
</p><timestamp>00:17:15</timestamp>
<p>Because she's like me!
</p><timestamp>00:17:17</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Do you think maybe this could be
more about <i>you </i>than it is about her?
</p><timestamp>00:17:22</timestamp>
<p>Yes, obviously, I have a lot of work
to do on myself. Everyone knows that.
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>But the important thing right now
is how I can fix things with Hollyhock.
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>Try to stay on topic, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>Well, an open conversation
about your concerns with--
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>No, that's too Diane-y.
She'd never buy it was coming from me.
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>Then why do you want my advice?
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>I got it. If I can somehow prove to her
what a jerk Miles is,
then she'll have to like me more
by default.
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>That's the BoJack way.
</p><timestamp>00:17:43</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, no--!
Oh-- oh...
</p><timestamp>00:17:46</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, that's... that's nice.
</p><timestamp>00:17:48</timestamp>
<p>Goldie, how would you like
to advance to the final round?
</p><timestamp>00:17:50</timestamp>
<p>I would do anything, and I mean, anything.
</p><timestamp>00:17:55</timestamp>
<p>-So I did it. I had sex with the PA.
-You had sex with him?
</p><timestamp>00:17:59</timestamp>
<p>That's what you wanted, right?
</p><timestamp>00:18:00</timestamp>
<p>I just said "seduce" the PA.
</p><timestamp>00:18:03</timestamp>
<p>Doesn't that mean have sex with him?
</p><timestamp>00:18:04</timestamp>
<p>No, I just wanted you to,
like, get him all hot and bothered.
</p><timestamp>00:18:08</timestamp>
<p>-Eh...?
-And <i>ready </i>to sleep with you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:10</timestamp>
<p>Then once you get him on audiotape
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p>-saying that he would sleep with you...
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>...come up with some excuse to get
out of there with virtue intact.
</p><timestamp>00:18:16</timestamp>
<p>That's a lot of specifics
you just assumed I would know.
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, the important thing is,
we got him now.
</p><timestamp>00:18:23</timestamp>
<p>Tell Miles what you told me.
</p><timestamp>00:18:25</timestamp>
<p>-I had sex with the PA.
-What PA?
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>
<p>I think his name was "Eggberg"?
</p><timestamp>00:18:30</timestamp>
<p>-What? Not him?
-That's the intern.
</p><timestamp>00:18:32</timestamp>
<p>-You said "PA."
-Did you think I was a PA? Nice!
</p><timestamp>00:18:35</timestamp>
<p>Why'd you want her to sleep with me?
</p><timestamp>00:18:37</timestamp>
<p>Not sleep with.
</p><timestamp>00:18:39</timestamp>
<p>You told a contestant
you would advance her to the final round
if she slept with a PA?
</p><timestamp>00:18:44</timestamp>
<p>I said "seduce." There is a distinction.
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p>We make a show about empowering women
and lifting them up,
and you cheapen it
with this coarse vulgarity.
</p><timestamp>00:18:52</timestamp>
<p>I cannot lie. You disgust me.
</p><timestamp>00:18:54</timestamp>
<p>This was all a big misunderstanding.
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>
<p>Cover up your bottom and go, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>You're not fit to judge
anyone's character, or their booties.
</p><timestamp>00:19:04</timestamp>
<p>So it <i>is </i>about judging booties.
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, BoJack.
-Miles.
</p><timestamp>00:19:09</timestamp>
<p>Don't want me dating your daughter,
you could have told me.
</p><timestamp>00:19:11</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:19:12</timestamp>
<p>Maybe we could've worked out
some sort of deal.
</p><timestamp>00:19:15</timestamp>
<p>What do you mean?
</p><timestamp>00:19:16</timestamp>
<p>All right, so I got this screenplay,
and I think it's a really fresh area.
</p><timestamp>00:19:19</timestamp>
<p>It's about a production intern
who wants to be a writer.
</p><timestamp>00:19:22</timestamp>
<p>Oh, wow.
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p>I think it could go somewhere
if it got in front of the right person.
</p><timestamp>00:19:26</timestamp>
<p>So if you have like an agent
or a manager you could give it to,
that would be awesome,
and I would never talk to Hollyhock again.
</p><timestamp>00:19:31</timestamp>
<p>I promise.
</p><timestamp>00:19:35</timestamp>
<p>So you were right. He <i>was </i>a dirtbag.
</p><timestamp>00:19:39</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I was kinda hoping
I was wrong for once.
</p><timestamp>00:19:41</timestamp>
<p>If it makes you feel any better,
you were wrong
about all the other parts of this.
</p><timestamp>00:19:45</timestamp>
<p>Diane, you are so bad
at making people feel better.
</p><timestamp>00:19:48</timestamp>
<p>Are you gonna tell Hollyhock?
</p><timestamp>00:19:49</timestamp>
<p>She's a smart girl.
She'll figure it out eventually.
</p><timestamp>00:19:53</timestamp>
<p>But for now, if she believes someone
can love her for who she really is,
then why would I take that
away from her?
</p><timestamp>00:19:58</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, you gotta get
one of these massages.
</p><timestamp>00:20:02</timestamp>
<p>-Oh-hh!

<p>-<subtitle>Mimi</subtitle> Goodbye, darling.
-<subtitle>Sissy</subtitle> It was good seeing you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:07</timestamp>
<p>-It was so much fun seeing you both.
-Thank you for hosting us.
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p>It was so nice to get away for the week
and learn all about
your charming little traditions
that didn't freak me out at all. Bye-bye!
</p><timestamp>00:20:16</timestamp>
<p>Did our little city mouse
have a nice time in the country?
</p><timestamp>00:20:19</timestamp>
<p>Everything was wonderful.
</p><timestamp>00:20:20</timestamp>
<p>And your little companion was darling--
for a week.
</p><timestamp>00:20:23</timestamp>
<p>But I do hope the next one you bring home
knows how to appreciate
a good Feast of Saint Squeaky.
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>Well, for your information,
there's not gonna <i>be </i>a "next one,"
because...

<p>I love Princess Carolyn and we're having
a baby and I couldn't be happier!

</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God! Um...
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter, why is our hotel room
filled with dentist clowns?
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>Don't be ridiculous, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:20:56</timestamp>
<p>They're not all dentist clowns.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>Half of them are clown dentists.
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>Just try to ignore them
and go about your business.
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-So, this is the incisor.
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>Doc, if this is what's incisor,
</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>I'd hate to see what's outsides 'er.
Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk!

<p>No.

to know you more is to love you less?
