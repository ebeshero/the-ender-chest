<p>...fucker!
</p><timestamp>00:00:12</timestamp>
<p>-So, we have some options.
-Yeah, a lot of options to discuss.
</p><timestamp>00:00:18</timestamp>
<p>-You know I love you.
-That's not what this is about.
</p><timestamp>00:00:20</timestamp>
<p>We always agreed
we didn't want kids, unless--
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>A streetwise but soulful teen
needed somewhere to live
as he waited
for his Juilliard audition.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>We'd support his dancing and let him
stay in the guest room, right.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>-But a baby? Are you--?
-It's not about me.
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>There's no "I" in uterus,
there's only "us."
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>And "U," and another "U,"
but that's the "U" that's in "us,"
so I already said that "U."
</p><timestamp>00:00:40</timestamp>
<p>The point is,
I'm going to be here for you, 24/7.
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p>Two hundred and forty-seven percent,
that's how "there for you" I'll be.
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p>-Whatever you decide...
-What we decide, because this is--
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>Definitely. This is a conversation.
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>Let's both say what we want
at the same time on three.
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-One, two--
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>On three or after three?
</p><timestamp>00:01:02</timestamp>
<p>How could I say it "on three"?
I'll be saying "three."
</p><timestamp>00:01:05</timestamp>
<p>-Okay. Okay.
-One, two, three...
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p>-Abortion.
-Get an abortion.
</p><timestamp>00:01:09</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no. We said different things.

<p>{\an8}Hey, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Diane, Diane, Diane.
-I'm doing my job, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Young people and their phones.
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}There could be a beautiful rainbow
in this room right now
</p><timestamp>00:03:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and you would have no idea.
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Really makes you think, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Can you look at rainbows on your phone?
</p><timestamp>00:03:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Shut up, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>phone pinging</subtitle>
-Shit.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>I just tweeted "Shut up, BoJack,"
as Cynthia Nixon.
</p><timestamp>00:03:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'd buy it. She is not a fan,
and for good reason.
</p><timestamp>00:03:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-We were up in the Poconos, she and I...
-BoJack, not now.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What's up your butt tonight?
-You really wanna know?
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I would seriously like to know
what crawled up your butt,
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}made a home for itself in your butt,
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}started a family, lived a fruitful life,
and then died up your butt.
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm getting an abortion.
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, that takes me back.
</p><timestamp>00:03:58</timestamp>
<p>I had more than my share of abortions
in the '90s.
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>I didn't get them, I paid for them.
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I really hope all those women
actually got the abortions,
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and didn't just keep my money.
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Diane, are you tweeting for pop starlet
Sextina Aquafina right now?
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm trying to. Why?
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Because her account
just tweeted out to 40 million followers,
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"I'm getting an abortion."
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What? No--
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>She--
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p>Oh, balls.
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>The tweet heard round the world.
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>Sextina Aquafina says,
"I'm getting an abortion."
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>And the world says, "Whaaa?"
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>If it's happening,
we're gonna talk about it.
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>It's time for Tom's Rant.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>Is Twitter an appropriate forum
to be discussing a sensitive issue
like abortion?
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>Wouldn't a better forum be nowhere?
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>Wait, does that say "Tom Srant"?
Why does that say Tom Srant?
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>I clearly said--
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>Randy, don't look at Jessica.
This is on you.
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>Diane, VIM is hanging on by a thread
and only barely scraping by
because of clients like Sextina.
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>Hey! Heard you pulled the trigger
on the Big Bear condo.
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>Great investment.
We are not on the edge of complete ruin.
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>We are on the edge of complete ruin.
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>I think if I explain it to her
and apologize, she'll understand.
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p>Because she's so understanding?
This is a teenage pop star.
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>Literally the two least
compassionate entities
combined into the supernova
of not understanding
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>-that is Sextina Aquafina.
-<subtitle>elevator dings</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. So imagine my surprise
when I'm in the middle of a performance
for Gaddafi's cousin on his yacht
and I'm in a giant champagne flute
singing "Left Titty"
and everyone starts to look
at their phones and look at me,
because I am apparently aborting a baby
I do not have.
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>So I had them turn their boat into a car
and drive me here to fire someone.
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>-I think that's me.
-Great. You're fired, Glasses.
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>background</subtitle> <music> Sextina!</music>
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>I'll put out a statement
explaining the whole mess. I am so sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>What "oh?" Who said you could "Oh?"
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>Taylor Swift just tweeted
that you were "brave."
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>Nicki Minaj tweeted at you
a face with heart eyes.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>And BuzzFeed just posted a list
of top 15 celebrities
who should have had abortions
like Sextina.
</p><timestamp>00:06:07</timestamp>
<p>-You're trending like crazy.
-I'm trending?
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>Most women who go through this
never talk about it
because it's so stigmatized.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>The fact that you're coming out like this
is huge.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>It would be, if you were
actually getting an abortion.
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>So what you're saying is,
maybe I <i>am </i>getting an abortion?
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>Well, no, because you're not.
</p><timestamp>00:06:26</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but if you did,
this would make you a cultural icon.
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>Glasses, you're un-fired.
I'm getting an abortion.
</p><timestamp>00:06:33</timestamp>
<p>-Well...
-I gotta go on talk shows.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>If I can make one woman
feel a little less alone,
then it's all worth it, right?
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>Yeah...
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>And if I can make a million women
buy my album,
then it's definitely all worth it.
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>Um...
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>-Diane, take the yes.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>Sextina Aquafina, you are now the face
of the pro-choice movement.
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>-Now let's get you informed.
-Hey! Uh, what?
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>crowd chattering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>So, before the procedure,
you'll need to look at an ultrasound
and listen to the heartbeat.
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>Or heartbeats, if you're having a litter.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>Why does she have to listen
to the heartbeat?
</p><timestamp>00:07:07</timestamp>
<p>It's the law. Also, by law,
I have to tell you that at one month,
your puppies have a favorite color
and that color may be blue.
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>-That can't be true.
-By law, I have to tell you that.
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>Also, before your procedure,
you'll need to watch
20 hours of cute puppy videos
as Sarah McLachlan's
"I Will Remember You" plays softly.
</p><timestamp>00:07:24</timestamp>
<p>Don't worry, Diane, I will watch
the cute puppy videos for you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:27</timestamp>
<p>-It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
-No, she has to watch the videos.
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>Don't worry, Diane, we will watch
the cute puppy videos together.
</p><timestamp>00:07:34</timestamp>
<p>-No, she has to watch them alone.
-Diane, I have some terrible news.
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Tomorrow, our exclusive interview
with the irrepressible provocateuse
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sextina Aquafina.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>But first, one thing that isn't
being aborted: the road to Oscar.
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>Tonight, the Leonard Maltin Awards.
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>Handing out trophies
to all the performances this year
that Leonard Maltin thought
were pretty good.
</p><timestamp>00:08:00</timestamp>
<p>And the Malty for Pretty Good Actor
goes to Bread Poot.
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p>You need another drink?
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>Why? Because I lost, I'm a loser,
so I have to drown my sorrows in scotch?
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>No, I just meant because of thirst.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>I could use a scotch.
</p><timestamp>00:08:24</timestamp>
<p>Oh, look. Jurj Clooners.
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>cameras clicking</subtitle>
-There he is, Jurj Clooners.
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>Hey, how are you? Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>Jurj sucks.
What does everyone love about him?
</p><timestamp>00:08:32</timestamp>
<p>He's not a god.
He's just an old guy who loves pranks.
</p><timestamp>00:08:36</timestamp>
<p>Sure sounds like God.
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p>-Jurj, hey, man.
-BoJack, right?
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, good to see you.
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Jurj, my name's Todd,
and my friend Keith sleeps on your couch.
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you know Keith?
Tell him to clean up his shit.
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>both laughing</subtitle>
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>That is so Keith.
</p><timestamp>00:08:53</timestamp>
<p>Todd, why don't you do the grown-ups
a favor and go find your own shadow?
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>It was here a second ago.
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p>Jurj, I loved you
in <i>The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:09:02</timestamp>
<p>How do you get in the head
of a war criminal?
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>You know,
I don't think of him as a war criminal.
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>I just think of him as a person
who had a funny accent.
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>Totally. I think I'm getting
the hang of all this now.
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>You won last night, the other guy
won tonight, maybe I'll win next time.
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>Yikes.
Look, man, you're not gonna be next.
</p><timestamp>00:09:21</timestamp>
<p>This will sound dumb
coming out of my mouth, but it's true.
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>So Jurj, Bread, Mitt, those are names.
Like real names.
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>Lernernerner DiCarpricorn, that's a name.
</p><timestamp>00:09:31</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack, not a name.
-Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>I figured they would, like,
tell you this stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>You're the Fifth Man. You get it, right?
</p><timestamp>00:09:38</timestamp>
<p>-Well--
-Yeah, you get it. Put her there.
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>zapping</subtitle>
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:09:41</timestamp>
<p>-Joy buzzer. You just got Jurjed!
-<subtitle>groaning</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:45</timestamp>
<p>All right, I'll see you later.
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>Vivica.
Now I know why they call you A. Fox.
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me, you gonna stay here long?
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>We got the OCD Image Awards tomorrow,
and those guys really like
a clean afterparty.
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groaning</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So, let me get this straight, Sextina.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Someone put a baby in your belly
and now you're like,
</p><timestamp>00:10:09</timestamp>
<p>"Awooga!
Is there an undo button around here?
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>Leggo my preggo."
</p><timestamp>00:10:13</timestamp>
<p>-Is that right?
-That is exactly correct, A Ryan,
but I am very excited for this opportunity
to put a face on this important issue.
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>One out of three women
will have an abortion in her life.
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>That sounds crazy high to me,
I don't buy it.
</p><timestamp>00:10:26</timestamp>
<p>I wanted to destigmatize the experience
for all women out there,
so I'm dropping a new single.
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>
<p>-What?
- <music> Surprise!</music>
</p><timestamp>00:10:33</timestamp>
<p>-New single?
-Just relax.

<p>Glasses, you did this.
You empowered me to tell my story.
</p><timestamp>00:11:04</timestamp>
<p>I think the tone might be a little severe?
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>Look, when you get an abortion,
you can express yourself however you want,
but this is about my body and my choices,
and my choice
is to be a totally insane badass.
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>Ugh! I <i>am </i>getting an abortion.

</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A daring battle cry from
the self-appointed New Voice of Choice.
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But has the concept of women
having choices gone too far?
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We've assembled this diverse panel
of white men in bow ties
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}to talk about abortion. Gentlemen?
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Tom, this is not just a woman's issue.
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm a man, but if I got pregnant,
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}would I put my life on hold
for a child I didn't want? Yes, I would.
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I can say that with confidence,
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}because I will never have to make
that decision, so I'm unbiased.
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Does this video glamorize abortion?
-Very possibly, Tom.
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Millennials today think everything is NBD.
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}NBD of course stands for No BD,
referring to B.D. Wong,
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}who teens think is a very big deal.
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So if something's not BD,
it means it's not a big deal.
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-These days, abortions are not BD.
-Are abortions even necessary?
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I heard a theory that if a woman
really has an unwanted pregnancy,
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}the body has a way to break the fetus down
into gas particles
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and then she can just fart it out.
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Where did you hear this intriguing
"fart it out" theory?
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I don't remember. Maybe the Bible?
-Thank you for clarifying.
</p><timestamp>00:12:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Next up, Jurj Clooners
is making audiences cry
</p><timestamp>00:12:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}in his new film, but his latest prank
might make you... think?
</p><timestamp>00:12:42</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groaning</subtitle>
Jurj. He likes pranks, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>I'll prank him. I'll prank him real good.
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>We'll need to draw him out.
What do A-list actors like?
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>Stretch limos? Nannies?
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>Flying their private jets
to disaster areas so they can "help out"?
</p><timestamp>00:12:56</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, limos. We'll get a limo.
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>I'll need one of those caps,
I'll be the driver.
</p><timestamp>00:13:00</timestamp>
<p>I'll pick him up,
and he'll be all like, "I'm Jurj, I suck,"
and then I'll be all, "Surprise,"
and hit him with a bat.
</p><timestamp>00:13:06</timestamp>
<p>Pranked!
</p><timestamp>00:13:07</timestamp>
<p>It really doesn't seem like a prank
as much as you hitting him with a bat.
</p><timestamp>00:13:11</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, it's a bad prank on purpose
to show how stupid pranks are.
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>-That's the point.
-Is that the point?
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>I'm working on levels here, man.
To the limousine repository.

</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>with accent</subtitle>
Good afternoon, Mr. Clooners.
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>Hey, man, just one sec,
my publicist is right behind me.
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>Of course. Bring the publicist.
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, shit.
-What's that, driver?
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>I said, "Auschwitz."
You're the Nazi who played Yahtzee.
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>Right, well, anyway, we're going
to the AOL-Time-Warner-PepsiCo-Viacom
</p><timestamp>00:13:43</timestamp>
<p>Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-Trader Joe's
Auditorium
for the Image Choice Spirit Awards.
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>Uh... okay, yes, ma'am.
Here I go. Driving, driving.
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p>You don't need to talk,
you can just drive.
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>Actually, can we make a couple stops?
</p><timestamp>00:13:57</timestamp>
<p>I am totally out of toilet paper,
so if you could find a Rite Aid.
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>You have to go in and buy the TP for me.
I'll get mobbed by fans if I go in.
</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p>Just pick out something
extra soft for my tushy.
</p><timestamp>00:14:09</timestamp>
<p>-I don't know
-Do as he says, driver.
</p><timestamp>00:14:10</timestamp>
<p>-Chop chop.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:14:16</timestamp>
<p>My concern is that you're
actually giving the pro-life movement
something to latch onto
as an example of--
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, you are so boring.
</p><timestamp>00:14:23</timestamp>
<p>Can I abort talking to you right now?
Abort.
</p><timestamp>00:14:26</timestamp>
<p>-You need to stop and think--
-Or what? You gonna sic Fido on me?
</p><timestamp>00:14:29</timestamp>
<p>I am just here for emotional support.
</p><timestamp>00:14:32</timestamp>
<p>Can you let it go?
I don't want to have to ask you again.
</p><timestamp>00:14:35</timestamp>
<p>I really think we have the chance
to say something here,
and all we're saying
is "Pshew pshew pow."
</p><timestamp>00:14:41</timestamp>
<p>-What is that?
-What are you doing?
</p><timestamp>00:14:42</timestamp>
<p>That's the gun sounds, from the song.
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>Uh. Do you mean, "Brrap brrap pew pew"?
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, that's what I did. "Pshow, kapow."
</p><timestamp>00:14:49</timestamp>
<p>-That's not what a gun sounds like.
-Prrow!
</p><timestamp>00:14:51</timestamp>
<p>-Pshow, kapow!
-Bop!
</p><timestamp>00:14:53</timestamp>
<p>-Brrap brrap pew pew!
-Ppew, ping!
</p><timestamp>00:14:55</timestamp>
<p>Can everyone please
stop making gun sounds?
</p><timestamp>00:14:57</timestamp>
<p>It is really freaking me out.
</p><timestamp>00:14:59</timestamp>
<p>My point is,
everyone's listening to you now.
</p><timestamp>00:15:01</timestamp>
<p>Soon people are gonna get bored
and move onto the next thing
and you'll hate yourself
that you weren't able to make a difference
when you had the chance.
</p><timestamp>00:15:08</timestamp>
<p>Believe me,
it happens sooner than you think.
</p><timestamp>00:15:10</timestamp>
<p>Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>
<p>Hi. I'm A Ryan Sea--
<subtitle>screaming</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:16</timestamp>
<p>Okay, we're here, finally. Get out.
</p><timestamp>00:15:19</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, can we make one more stop?
</p><timestamp>00:15:21</timestamp>
<p>I just remembered
we left my wife back at the house.
</p><timestamp>00:15:24</timestamp>
<p>Can we go back? Pwease?
</p><timestamp>00:15:26</timestamp>
<p>Driver? The man said, "Pwease."
</p><timestamp>00:15:28</timestamp>
<p>That's it. Enough.
I am not your driver. It is I, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasping</subtitle>
BoJack? What are you doing?
</p><timestamp>00:15:35</timestamp>
<p>I was gonna prank Jurj
by hitting him with this bat,
but you got into the car because,
apparently, you are a two-timing liar.
</p><timestamp>00:15:42</timestamp>
<p>What's the thing with the bat?
</p><timestamp>00:15:43</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, this is not a good look on you.
</p><timestamp>00:15:46</timestamp>
<p>All this time,
I thought you believed in me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p>This is why your clients win every year.
You represent everyone.
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>It has nothing to do with whether
you're a good publicist or not.
</p><timestamp>00:15:53</timestamp>
<p>I am a marvelous publicist.
</p><timestamp>00:15:55</timestamp>
<p>Not to me. You're doing great work
for this asshole who loves pranks.
</p><timestamp>00:15:58</timestamp>
<p>You're pranking him right now.
</p><timestamp>00:15:59</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, with a bad prank
to show how stupid pranks are.
</p><timestamp>00:16:03</timestamp>
<p>Seems a little convoluted,
which is actually a trademark
of a great prank.
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>Well played, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:16:09</timestamp>
<p>No, it's a bad prank.
That's my point. Pranks are dumb.
</p><timestamp>00:16:12</timestamp>
<p>We're late, and I won't keep going
round and round with you on this.
</p><timestamp>00:16:15</timestamp>
<p>Publicists have many clients.
</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>
<p>Not my publicist. You're fired.
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>Are you kidding?
Who fires Ana Spanakopita?
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>I do. I just did.
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>scoffing</subtitle> Who's gonna set up
your press appearances?
</p><timestamp>00:16:25</timestamp>
<p>Your hopeless agent? Your idiot sidekick?
</p><timestamp>00:16:28</timestamp>
<p>Not your problem.
Get the hell out of my limo.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>'Cause I gotta pick up
a bachelorette party in 30 minutes.
</p><timestamp>00:16:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sextina, welcome to the program.
Can I get a "pew pew" for the fans?
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Tom, abortion is a very serious subject.
-Yes, very serious, I agree.
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I want to tell the real story
about abortion,
</p><timestamp>00:16:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}show America what it's really about,
</p><timestamp>00:16:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}which is why your girl Sextina Aquafina
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}is gonna have her abortion
live on television.
</p><timestamp>00:16:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What what?
</p><timestamp>00:16:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Pay-per-view, chitches.
</p><timestamp>00:16:57</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p>"Pay-per-view, chitches."
Brrap brrap, pew pew, ka-ching ka-ching.
</p><timestamp>00:17:02</timestamp>
<p>How are you going to have
an abortion on live TV
when you're not even
really having an abortion?
</p><timestamp>00:17:07</timestamp>
<p>-Duh, we'll just <i>Argo </i>that shit.
-What does that mean?
</p><timestamp>00:17:09</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Fake abortion.
Movie magic, like in <i>Argo.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:13</timestamp>
<p>That is not what happened in <i>Argo.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:15</timestamp>
<p>If we're gonna do this,
we got to be real tasteful.
</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, only the best for my abortion.
All class.
</p><timestamp>00:17:21</timestamp>
<p>John Carpenter
can do the practical effects.
</p><timestamp>00:17:23</timestamp>
<p>-He owes me a favor.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>We'll book Eddie Redmayne as the fetus.
</p><timestamp>00:17:27</timestamp>
<p>Are you hearing yourselves?
</p><timestamp>00:17:29</timestamp>
<p>We're not going to fake an abortion
on live TV.
</p><timestamp>00:17:32</timestamp>
<p>Obviously, we'll pre-tape it.
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>Then put a little box in the corner
of the screen that says "Live."
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>You don't think
this is incredibly disrespectful
to the women who actually get abortions?
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>Not if we do it tasteful.
</p><timestamp>00:17:43</timestamp>
<p>Diane, this is what the client wants.
Stop making it about you.
</p><timestamp>00:17:47</timestamp>
<p>I'm not making it about me.
</p><timestamp>00:17:48</timestamp>
<p>-I am so tired of you creating problems.
-I'm not--
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry you're so fertile
and in a sexually active,
loving relationship
and now you don't want a family.
</p><timestamp>00:17:58</timestamp>
<p>-I'm sure that's really hard for you.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:18:01</timestamp>
<p>Uh... if this is not about me anymore,
then I'mma go.
</p><timestamp>00:18:05</timestamp>
<p>Y'all figure your shit out
and get back at me.
</p><timestamp>00:18:07</timestamp>
<p>Where's that ZZ Top mofo at?
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>Can a chitch
get a parking validation or what?
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p>Is there something you want to say to me?
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:15</timestamp>
<p>I have given everything to get where I am,

</p><timestamp>00:18:21</timestamp>
<p>She wants an abortion?
I'm getting her an abortion.
</p><timestamp>00:18:24</timestamp>
<p>-You know this is bullshit.
-It's all bullshit, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>
<p>That's the gig. And you're not good enough
at this job to be too good for this job.
</p><timestamp>00:18:31</timestamp>
<p>I won't be a part of this.
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>

<p>Yo, Beardo, where did you go?
</p><timestamp>00:18:38</timestamp>
<p>I need to get my parking validation did,
or I cannot leave.
</p><timestamp>00:18:41</timestamp>
<p>Y'all's trippin' if you think
Sextina Aquafina
is paying $15 for parking.
</p><timestamp>00:18:48</timestamp>
<p>All right, new publicist.
What do you got for me?
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>Secretariat was an athlete, right?
And you used to be an athlete.
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>
<p>What? No, I didn't.
</p><timestamp>00:18:57</timestamp>
<p>You didn't play baseball and football?
Oh, um...
</p><timestamp>00:19:01</timestamp>
<p>You know, I think I Googled the wrong guy.
</p><timestamp>00:19:03</timestamp>
<p>-Did you think I was Bo Jackson?
-This idea I know you're going to like.
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p>You know that car wash on Alvarado?
</p><timestamp>00:19:09</timestamp>
<p>They need someone to dress up
like a gorilla and spin a sign.
</p><timestamp>00:19:15</timestamp>
<p>Why would I do that?
</p><timestamp>00:19:16</timestamp>
<p>Anything that gets your face
out there, right?
</p><timestamp>00:19:18</timestamp>
<p>How does it get my face out there
dressed like a gorilla?
</p><timestamp>00:19:21</timestamp>
<p>Maybe that one's a dud,
but hey, you think Lou Bega
knocked it out of the park
with "Mambo Number One"?
</p><timestamp>00:19:27</timestamp>
<p>-No, but he kept at it.

</p><timestamp>00:19:34</timestamp>
<p>I'm making things all about me?
I'm the one who's having an abortion.
</p><timestamp>00:19:38</timestamp>
<p>-It's ridiculous.
-They're completely morally bankrupt.
</p><timestamp>00:19:42</timestamp>
<p>I agree with you, 247 percent.
</p><timestamp>00:19:44</timestamp>
<p>I just wrote "morally bankrupt"
on this form.
</p><timestamp>00:19:47</timestamp>
<p>You were right to do that.
This form is being very nosy right now.
</p><timestamp>00:19:50</timestamp>
<p>Why did I even take that job?
</p><timestamp>00:19:52</timestamp>
<p>You were going through a rough time,
Princess Carolyn wanted to help you
and she offered you the job.
</p><timestamp>00:19:57</timestamp>
<p>Which she should not have done.
So morally bankrupt.
</p><timestamp>00:20:01</timestamp>
<p>Okay, yeah, that was nice.
</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>But still,
she is putting her company's bottom line
before the very real damage
that bottle-nosed maniac
is doing every time
she gets on the news and--
</p><timestamp>00:20:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasping</subtitle>
That's it, the news.
</p><timestamp>00:20:13</timestamp>
<p>I gotta take the high road,
go on the news and rat those suckers out.
</p><timestamp>00:20:16</timestamp>
<p>Is that really a good idea?
</p><timestamp>00:20:18</timestamp>
<p>It is if you think it is,
because I am here to support you
no matter what,
but maybe it isn't the best idea?
</p><timestamp>00:20:25</timestamp>
<p>Like, if that idea were a Dillon brother
maybe it's a Kevin, not a Matt?
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p>Someone has to tell the world
that Sextina is a total fraud.
</p><timestamp>00:20:34</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>girl</subtitle> You know Sextina Aquafina?
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>-Oh. Yeah, I mean, I work with her.
-Oh. She is so cool.
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>Sextina's music makes me feel strong,
like I can do anything.
</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>It doesn't offend you?
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>What about the part where she says,
</p><timestamp>00:20:48</timestamp>
<p>"I hope and pray to God
my little fetus has a soul
</p><timestamp>00:20:51</timestamp>
<p>'cause I want it to feel pain
when I eject it from my hole"?
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>It's a joke.
You get that it's a joke, right?
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>Well, obviously.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>Do you think she actually wants
to shoot her fetus with a gun?
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>-No, I get it.
-Getting an abortion is scary.
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>With all the protesters out front,
how you have to listen
to the heartbeat and all that.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>When you can joke about it,
it makes it less scary, you know?

and get you that Oscar.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>So nobody else, huh? Good.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>Just all your hopes and dreams
pinned on me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>Somehow beating the odds
and winning the highest possible accolade
in an actor's career.
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>-I know we can do it.
-Just me, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>Wow, that's actually. That--
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>Is someone standing on my windpipe?
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>Let's just get Jurj on the phone so we--
</p><timestamp>00:22:17</timestamp>
<p>No, BoJack. I believe in you, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, Ana, what are you--?
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, boy.
-Shh... It's okay.
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>-When you fired me, it was thrilling.
-Oh. Ana...
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>Nobody talks to me like that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>It reminded me that I work for you,
and I liked that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>Okay, but--
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>Do you like that?
Being in control? Being the star?
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p>Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>You're my star, BoJack. My shining star.
</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>
<p>-But don't you ever...
-Ow, too tight.
</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p>-...try to screw me again.
-Ouch! Oh, please.
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>-Do you understand?
-Yes. God, yes.
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>Good.
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p>I'll see you tomorrow bright and early.
You have my undivided attention now.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...

<i>How are you feeling, Sextina?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Sextina</subtitle> <i>A little queasy</i>
<i>but on the whole, wonderful.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>doctor</subtitle> <i>Good. Now, I do accept tips.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p>-That was surprisingly tasteful.
-And educational, right?
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Weirdly educational.
</p><timestamp>00:23:17</timestamp>
<p>I actually learned a lot about abortion,
and I just had an abortion.
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>-How are you feeling?
-I feel shitty.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>I mean, physically.
</p><timestamp>00:23:26</timestamp>
<p>I'm glad I did it,
but mostly I just felt old.
</p><timestamp>00:23:30</timestamp>
<p>There were all these teenagers there.
Twenty-somethings.
</p><timestamp>00:23:33</timestamp>
<p>I know from the outside, it might seem
like I should be ready for kids,
but I can't--
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>Diane, you don't need
to explain anything to anyone.
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>phone buzzing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>-Sextina. Great job, we did it.
<i>-Yeah, so, little wrinkle.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>I've been having a lot of sex, you know,
</p><timestamp>00:23:53</timestamp>
<p>'cause I'm a sexual creature
and dolphins do have sex for pleasure.
</p><timestamp>00:23:57</timestamp>
<p>I just found out
I got knocked up for real.
</p><timestamp>00:23:59</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-And I think I want to keep it.
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>But that might be a little confusing
to my fans,
since they just saw me
get the old scoopity doopity?
</p><timestamp>00:24:09</timestamp>
<p>Okay, we're gonna handle this.
Meet us at the office in 20 minutes.
</p><timestamp>00:24:13</timestamp>
<p>First thing is we gotta get her
out of town before she starts to show.
</p><timestamp>00:24:17</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, we'll send her to that farm
where celebrities go to disappear,
where Chad Michael Murray
and Thora Birch went.
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p>Film a bunch of music videos now,
and then--
</p><timestamp>00:24:25</timestamp>
<p>Release them over the next year
so it seems like she's still around.
</p><timestamp>00:24:29</timestamp>
<p>Then when she comes back,
we'll say she adopted a baby.
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Carolyn</subtitle> People are going to love that.
<subtitle>Diane</subtitle> Yeah. Everyone loves a baby.
