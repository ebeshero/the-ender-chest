<p>I'm sorry
I broke your expensive bachelor vase.
</p><timestamp>00:00:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>audience</subtitle> Aww.
</p><timestamp>00:00:12</timestamp>
<p>That's all right. I've learned
that when you're in a loving family
there's nothing wrong
with a little horsin' around.
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughter, applause</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:20</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Herb</subtitle> Cut!
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>That's the show, folks.
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast.
</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>Joelle.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>Bradley.
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>Little Sarah Lynn.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>And our star, BoJack Horseman!
</p><timestamp>00:00:33</timestamp>
<p>Thanks for coming out.
Thank you very much.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
-Wow!
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>Great pilot.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>We got the biggest laugh I ever heard
with that "gag me with a spoon" joke.
</p><timestamp>00:00:42</timestamp>
<p>And then we topped it
with the "get a room" joke.
</p><timestamp>00:00:45</timestamp>
<p>This was so fun.
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>Do we get to make more?
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p>I think we got a real shot.
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>And as long as the ratings don't dip
below a dismal 15 million a night,
we could be on the air for many years.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>-No way!
-All right!
</p><timestamp>00:00:57</timestamp>
<p>-Your Squirt, sir.
-Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>And if that happens,
take care of each other.
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>No matter what,
we're going to stick together.
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>unintelligible groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>♪♪</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>unintelligible groans continue</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Thank you, Tina,
for those touching grunts and growls.
</p><timestamp>00:02:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm Henry Winkler.
</p><timestamp>00:02:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You probably remember me
from my 2002 guest role
</p><timestamp>00:02:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}on <i>Law &amp;amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Whoo!
-Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:02:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But perhaps the greatest role
I've ever played is friend.
</p><timestamp>00:02:31</timestamp>
<p>Herb was a dear friend
and I am honored to be dedicating
this bench in his memory.
</p><timestamp>00:02:39</timestamp>
<p>In his last days, Herb's cancer
had gone into remission.
</p><timestamp>00:02:42</timestamp>
<p>He was full of hope.
</p><timestamp>00:02:44</timestamp>
<p>But on the drive home from the hospital,
his brakes gave out,
he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.
</p><timestamp>00:02:49</timestamp>
<p>He survived the crash,
but he was allergic to peanuts.
</p><timestamp>00:02:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}He died instantly.
</p><timestamp>00:02:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Let us now read his final tweets.
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>"I'm gonna live forever!
</p><timestamp>00:02:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hashtag 'cancer free.'
</p><timestamp>00:03:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hashtag 'invincible.'
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>Hashtag 'tweeting while driving.'
</p><timestamp>00:03:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, no, I think I'm gonna hit that truck.
</p><timestamp>00:03:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hashtag 'hopefully it isn't full
of peanuts.'
</p><timestamp>00:03:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hashtag 'Oh, no. It was full of peanuts.'"
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>I was wondering
where you wandered off to.
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, shit. Hey.
-Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>I'm no good with funerals.
</p><timestamp>00:03:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}When I cry, it messes up my makeup
and then I get really bummed out.
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yeah, same for me.
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Herb told me you came
by the house last summer.
</p><timestamp>00:03:28</timestamp>
<p>Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:03:30</timestamp>
<p>Did he tell you anything else?
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No, we talked about cancer,
how hard it is living with cancer,
about the L.A. Kings,
and then back to cancer.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>-Probably--
-Then I read that chapter in your book
about how he never forgave you
and he tried to kick you out of the house
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and you ended up wrestling on the floor
over a telescope.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Oh, you did read that part?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:03:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I just wish
there was something I could do.
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Okay, I gotta go.
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>You wanna go grab a cup of vodka?
I-- I'm sorry, the funeral.
</p><timestamp>00:03:58</timestamp>
<p>I mean, a bottle of vodka?
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No. You should stick around.
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hey, maybe you'll find
that something you're looking for.
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But if you're ever in New Mexico,
drop me a line.
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}New Mexico?
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I thought you lived in Maine.
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I always pictured you there.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A little house by a lake?
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>I was just there for, like, a month,
30 years ago.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>-I live outside Santa Fe now.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Think everyone here read my book?
-I didn't.
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>Of course you didn't.
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>Here's the CliffsNotes version:
Shut up, Todd!
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.
</p><timestamp>00:04:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk
of your car for the next few hours.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>Have fun being sad.
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>Do you know what you're supposed to do
with our date pits?
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>Why serve dates
and not have a place to put the pits?
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>You know,
some people just have no class.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>What are you doing here?
You didn't know Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:04:50</timestamp>
<p>No, but I do know a hot ticket,
and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.
</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>Henry Winkler,
Jake and Maggot Gyllenhaal,
that Pakistani girl
who keeps winning Nobel Prizes.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>There's so much to hate
about what you just said.
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>Good news. You know when someone dies,
everyone wants to buy their shit?
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>You're lucky you have a piece
of <i>Horsin' Around,</i>
because this is where money
starts rolling in.
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>I don't want that. That's blood money.
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>Well, what do you want me to do with it?
It's coming.
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. Give it to some orphans.
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>-I can't deal with this.
-Oh, come on!
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>You don't think Elton John
was raking it in when Diana died?
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>More like "Candle in the Windfall."
Cha-ching! Hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Herb</subtitle> <i>You have to live with the shitty</i>
<i>thing you did for the rest of your life.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>British accent</subtitle> Hello, love.
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Joelle,
I actually came here to be alone.
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p>I just flew in across the pond
and I don't know which end is up.
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>This might be a stupid question,
but were you always so... British?
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>Oh, let's get some light in here,
it's so dreadfully dreary.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure
you used to be American.
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>That's better.
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>Hey, this one's having a freak-out.
She needs to lie down.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>I'm not freaking out.
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>I just don't understand
why that lady was being all judgy.
</p><timestamp>00:06:03</timestamp>
<p>You were touching her face
and telling her she was gonna die next.
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm eccentric. I do weird shit.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>How is that my problem?
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>Hey, when was the last time
all four of us were in the same room?
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>Probably not since the show ended.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I left California
pretty much right after.
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>Now I got the biggest hardware store
in Seattle.
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>That's a lie. We're actually in Olympia.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>And I'm on the West End
playing Juliet's... nurse.
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>-And how are your kids?
-I don't have any kids.
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I just assumed
you had a bunch of kids,
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>'cause, you know, your body.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>Come on, Sarah Lynn.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>I assumed
you weren't still a massive cunt.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>-Jesus Christ, Joelle.
-That's an okay thing to say in England.
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>Shove it up your ass
with a spoonful of sugar,
you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>-Guys, hey, hey, come on.
-Let go of me!
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>-I'm gonna hulk out!
-Guys, can we just be civil for one day?
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, you're one to talk.
-What's that mean?
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>Were you being civil
when you had sex with my mom?
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p>What? I never-- Why would--? Wait, which
one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-This sucks. You guys suck.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>I don't even know
why I came to this party.
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.
</p><timestamp>00:07:07</timestamp>
<p>Herb died?
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>You know, maybe it's for the best
we don't get together that often.
</p><timestamp>00:07:11</timestamp>
<p>We'd most likely drive each other mad.
</p><timestamp>00:07:13</timestamp>
<p>Well, no one knows how to get
under your skin like family.
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>We're not a family, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>We probably won't even see each other
again, until the next funeral.
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>-Why are you all looking at me?
-You are the oldest.
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>You are a severe alcoholic.
</p><timestamp>00:07:27</timestamp>
<p>I'm honestly so high right now,
I don't even know where I'm looking.
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories,
and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi--
</p><timestamp>00:07:36</timestamp>
<p>Pardon me. Is one of you Sarah Lynn?
</p><timestamp>00:07:39</timestamp>
<p>I am. Of course. God, are you blind?
</p><timestamp>00:07:42</timestamp>
<p>Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>Well, forgive me.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>Per the instructions of his last will
and testament, I am to give you this disk.
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>Am I close?
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>Just take the disk from the guy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:57</timestamp>
<p>It contains directions to Herb's gold.
</p><timestamp>00:08:00</timestamp>
<p>Herb's gold?
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p>There were no further details.
</p><timestamp>00:08:03</timestamp>
<p>He was a peculiar client.
</p><timestamp>00:08:05</timestamp>
<p>I told him, I'm not actually an attorney,
</p><timestamp>00:08:08</timestamp>
<p>I'm just a blind man.
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>Still, Herb thought me wise
for some reason.
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>Perhaps it is my overly formal
manner of speech.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>I bid you good day.
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>Oh, pardon me. Ow!
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>Right at shin level.
</p><timestamp>00:08:22</timestamp>
<p>What are we supposed to do
with a floppy disk?
</p><timestamp>00:08:25</timestamp>
<p>Hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:08:26</timestamp>
<p>So, what's up, kiddo?
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>BoJack and my mom
are becoming, like, friends
and they're acting real weird.
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>Oof! Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>rattling overhead</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>Hey, guys, guys, come on!
</p><timestamp>00:08:36</timestamp>
<p>There's somebody beneath you!
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>Jeez, all day with the...
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>Listen, kiddo, forget about them.
</p><timestamp>00:08:41</timestamp>
<p>You wanna check out
this cool new game I got?
</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>
<p>You have solitaire? On your computer?
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>Wow!
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.
</p><timestamp>00:08:53</timestamp>
<p>I bet it's still in his old office.
Unless somebody else moved in.
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember?
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>Because it was under tap dancing star
Savion Glover's office. Let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:09:02</timestamp>
<p>-What? Right now?
-Yeah. Don't you get it?
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>Herb's giving us a reunion special.
</p><timestamp>00:09:06</timestamp>
<p>Remember how he always wanted to do
a treasure hunt episode of <i>Horsin' Around</i>
but the network said it was too edgy?
This is that episode.
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>-I just don't know.
-Yeah, I don't want to do that.
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>Wait, so you'd rather just stay
at this funeral and be sad,
instead of going on a crazy adventure
to find our dead friend's secret treasure?
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>Do you have any idea
how insane you sound?
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I get it.
You just don't wanna be here.
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>No, that's not it.
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>Herb clearly wanted us to do this,
as a family.
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>Who cares what he wanted?
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>He doesn't, because he's dead.
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p>And we all know he hated your guts.
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. He was my best friend
and he died hating me
and nothing I do is gonna change that,
but Herb left you that disk
because he wanted us to find his gold.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>If we can honor Herb's last wish,
then that's something.
</p><timestamp>00:09:49</timestamp>
<p>I don't know what, but it's something.
</p><timestamp>00:09:53</timestamp>
<p>-Okay. For Herb.
-Fine.
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>-Shotgun!
-Everyone knows you can't call shotgun
</p><timestamp>00:09:58</timestamp>
<p>-before you see the car!
-My turn! Get out of my way!
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>Brad, hang on one second.
</p><timestamp>00:10:02</timestamp>
<p>Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?
</p><timestamp>00:10:05</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:10:07</timestamp>
<p>Hi, Henry Winkler.
</p><timestamp>00:10:09</timestamp>
<p>I loved you in that one episode
of <i>Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>Oh, thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>How would you like
to narrate a documentary for--
</p><timestamp>00:10:16</timestamp>
<p>Hey, listen, I am so flattered,
but today is about Herb,
so let's respect that.
</p><timestamp>00:10:22</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God, I-- I'm so sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:10:24</timestamp>
<p>I'll let you get back to your business.
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Winkly, such a shame, isn't it?
About our friend Herb?
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>
<p>It really burns my brisket
that some people would turn a funeral
into some kind of schmoozefest.
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I know.
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p>Those other people are the worst.
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>I bet that woman barely knew Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, hi, I'm Henry.
</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>
<p>I used to volunteer with Herb
at Habitat For Humanity.
</p><timestamp>00:10:48</timestamp>
<p>Or as we like to call it,
Herbitat For Henranity. <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>We spent most of the day working
on that name,
and only part of the day building,
but still, we helped some people.
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>-How did you know Herb?
-We also volunteered at a, um...
soup plantation-- Kitchen! Soup kitchen!
Whichever one is the good one.
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>What? I never knew you did that.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.
</p><timestamp>00:11:13</timestamp>
<p>Oh, hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, why don't you
talk about how you knew Herb?
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I never met the guy.
I'm just here to schmooze.
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>Tell us about your thing, though,
it sounds fascinating.
</p><timestamp>00:11:23</timestamp>
<p>Everyone, gather round and listen
to Princess Carolyn's story.
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>Wow, Herb kept all this old stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>He sure did.
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>Look, one of those answering machines
with tapes.
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p><i>Mr. Kazzaz, this is Manny from Pep Boys.</i>

<p><i>We fixed the brakes on your car,</i>

<p><i>Just to reiterate,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p><i>and shouldn't give you any more trouble.</i>

<p><i>Unless, of course,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p><i>but why would anyone do that?</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I'm rambling.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p><i>Probably because I'm such a big fan.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>Horsin' Around<i> was a goddamn riot!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p><i>I especially loved those kids.</i>

</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>Mm... How curious.
</p><timestamp>00:12:10</timestamp>
<p>How could you like <i>Horsin' Around</i>
but not the horse?
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>That's like watching <i>Castle</i>
but hating castles.
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I've never seen it.
I assume it's about castles.
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>-Wow!
-<subtitle>all yell</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>Look at all these old 20th century relics.
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>-How did you get here?
-I was in your trunk.
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>Now I'm in outer space.
</p><timestamp>00:12:30</timestamp>
<p>Cut it out with your childish high jinks.
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, can't I help?
</p><timestamp>00:12:35</timestamp>
<p>Here's 10 bucks. There's a Squirt machine
by the garage. Get five cans.
</p><timestamp>00:12:38</timestamp>
<p>You got it. I won't let you down.
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>clattering, thumping</subtitle>
-Oh, no!
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>Your mom, was her name Karen?
</p><timestamp>00:12:44</timestamp>
<p>-Can we drop it?
-Something with a "K"?
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>Her name is Nora. You know,
my parents got a divorce because of you.
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>Nora? I don't know.
I banged so many chicks in the '80s.
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>Okay, Todd, you can do this.
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>Five Squirts.
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>You just need to take this money
and put it in that machine.
</p><timestamp>00:13:03</timestamp>
<p>This-- Wait, what?
What happened to the $10?
</p><timestamp>00:13:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>
<p>No! Wind! Be cool!

</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>Why does this always happen to me?
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>Looks like Herb set up a password.
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>Oh, this is easy. Try "BoJack."
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>-No. Didn't work.
-"BoJack-BFF"?
</p><timestamp>00:13:30</timestamp>
<p>"BoJack-I-Forgive-You"?
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm out of ideas.
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>Hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>I'm just, like, so mad.
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>Well, you should be.
</p><timestamp>00:13:40</timestamp>
<p>You're on the show
that fired Herb Kazzaz.
</p><timestamp>00:13:43</timestamp>
<p>What are the writers doing to my baby?
Are they killing it?
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>Are they putting my baby into a car,
then driving the car into a lake?
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>Topical! I still got it!
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>They keep giving the best story lines
to Sarah Lynn.
</p><timestamp>00:13:54</timestamp>
<p>I haven't gotten
a single very special episode.
</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>When am I gonna learn
about drunk driving?
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>Don't worry so much.
It's my legacy they're crapping all over.
</p><timestamp>00:14:02</timestamp>
<p>You're gonna come out
smelling like a daisy.
</p><timestamp>00:14:04</timestamp>
<p><i>You're too good for this TV stuff, anyway.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p>You're a real actress,
you should be doing theater.
</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>
<p>Hold on.
</p><timestamp>00:14:09</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Joelle.
Wanna go to the mall this weekend?
</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p>Don't you have any friends
your own age from school?
</p><timestamp>00:14:14</timestamp>
<p>No. My mom's boyfriend home-schools me.
He's a photographer.
</p><timestamp>00:14:18</timestamp>
<p>I'm going to the Lilith Fair this weekend
to support female solidarity.
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>-So scram!
-Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:14:24</timestamp>
<p>Hey, be nicer to Sarah Lynn, will you?
She didn't choose this life.
</p><timestamp>00:14:27</timestamp>
<p>Remember this word: family.
</p><timestamp>00:14:29</timestamp>
<p>Okay? You two are family,
whether you like it or not,
and that's the most important thing.
You listening? What's the most important?
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>Family. It's family. I get it.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>I've got it! The password is...
</p><timestamp>00:14:42</timestamp>
<p>"password."
</p><timestamp>00:14:45</timestamp>
<p>It worked!
</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>Good thinking, Joelle.
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>So in that memory,
were you British or American?
</p><timestamp>00:14:49</timestamp>
<p>The disk just has just one file on it,
it's--
</p><timestamp>00:14:52</timestamp>
<p>It's the address of a storage locker
in Van Nuys.
</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>A storage locker? Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:14:57</timestamp>
<p>This treasure hunt sucks.
</p><timestamp>00:14:58</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>rattling overhead</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>At long last, can you keep down the noise,
keep down the funk?
</p><timestamp>00:15:04</timestamp>
<p>If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing,
it would have caught on by now!
</p><timestamp>00:15:12</timestamp>
<p>And when the mayor gave us the key
to the city,
</p><timestamp>00:15:16</timestamp>
<p>Herb said, "Volunteering isn't about keys.
It's about people."
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>
<p>-How touching.
-Good story.
</p><timestamp>00:15:23</timestamp>
<p>-Who are you again?
-Wow, that was touching.
</p><timestamp>00:15:26</timestamp>
<p>A story that could never be topped.
</p><timestamp>00:15:28</timestamp>
<p>Or could it?
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn, sing us another song
in the key of Kazzaz.
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p>You clearly knew the man so well.
</p><timestamp>00:15:35</timestamp>
<p>Please tell us another story
but with even more details.
</p><timestamp>00:15:39</timestamp>
<p>Yes. That's a great idea, Mr. Dog-Man.
</p><timestamp>00:15:42</timestamp>
<p>Tell us another story, Pink Cat Lady.
</p><timestamp>00:15:45</timestamp>
<p>Story, story!
</p><timestamp>00:15:46</timestamp>
<p>Come on, everybody.
What is this, a funeral?
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all</subtitle> Story, story, story!
</p><timestamp>00:15:52</timestamp>
<p>Well, you blew it again.
</p><timestamp>00:15:54</timestamp>
<p>You really are a dweeb.
</p><timestamp>00:15:56</timestamp>
<p>Don't say that.
</p><timestamp>00:15:57</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, who are you?
</p><timestamp>00:16:00</timestamp>
<p>Some kind of magical trash troll?
</p><timestamp>00:16:02</timestamp>
<p>No. I'm a janitor.
</p><timestamp>00:16:03</timestamp>
<p>But I was clearing out some
of the old stages,
and I found this transformation chamber.
</p><timestamp>00:16:09</timestamp>
<p>Looks like a bunch of old junk.
</p><timestamp>00:16:11</timestamp>
<p>Let me tell you a story.
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>
<p>Back in the '90s, the biggest dweeb
of them all was Steve Urkel.
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>It was so funny how he never knew
whether or not he did that.
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>Right.
Well, nerdy Steve Urkel invented a machine
that transformed him
into the debonair Stefan Urquelle.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Janitor, you're standing next
to a machine right now.
</p><timestamp>00:16:35</timestamp>
<p>Yes. That's why I brought it up.
</p><timestamp>00:16:37</timestamp>
<p>Now, this is just a prop.
</p><timestamp>00:16:39</timestamp>
<p>But it represents a very powerful idea.
</p><timestamp>00:16:42</timestamp>
<p>So if I go through that magic machine,
I'll become cool and confident?
</p><timestamp>00:16:47</timestamp>
<p>No, it's a-- It's a prop. I just said--
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>inhales, exhales deeply</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:55</timestamp>
<p>-I feel different.
-Now, son--
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p>Todd? Who's Todd?
</p><timestamp>00:17:00</timestamp>
<p>My name's Toad. Toad Chavay.
</p><timestamp>00:17:03</timestamp>
<p>And I gotta get my bubble on.
</p><timestamp>00:17:05</timestamp>
<p>Machine? Squirt me. Hi-yah!
</p><timestamp>00:17:11</timestamp>
<p>That'll do, machine.
</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>Hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:17:20</timestamp>
<p>Look at all this
<i>Horsin' Around </i>fan correspondence
</p><timestamp>00:17:23</timestamp>
<p>Herb received in the post. Capital!
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>Guys.
</p><timestamp>00:17:29</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:29</timestamp>
<p>Someone already got to Herb's gold.
</p><timestamp>00:17:32</timestamp>
<p>Oh, shit.
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>There's a bunch of fur in here.
</p><timestamp>00:17:36</timestamp>
<p>It's bear fur.
</p><timestamp>00:17:38</timestamp>
<p>I can tell. My stepdad was a bear.
</p><timestamp>00:17:40</timestamp>
<p>Herb's nurse is a bear.
You think she knew about this gold?
</p><timestamp>00:17:44</timestamp>
<p>Hey, listen to this letter.
I think it might be a clue.
</p><timestamp>00:17:47</timestamp>
<p>Ahem. "Dear Herb,
just finished reading your novel.
</p><timestamp>00:17:50</timestamp>
<p>It's phenomenal.
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>I'm jealous. I wish I wrote it.
</p><timestamp>00:17:54</timestamp>
<p>Sincerely, Henry Winkler,
the guy from that one episode
of <i>Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:18:00</timestamp>
<p>Herb wrote a novel?
</p><timestamp>00:18:01</timestamp>
<p>Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:18:04</timestamp>
<p>You look thin. Did you get into CrossFit?
</p><timestamp>00:18:06</timestamp>
<p>No, Sarah Lynn, I'm dying.
</p><timestamp>00:18:08</timestamp>
<p>Whatever it is, it is super slimming.
I am for totes jel over here.
</p><timestamp>00:18:11</timestamp>
<p>It's rectal cancer.
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p>Ew! Some of us are eating.
</p><timestamp>00:18:15</timestamp>
<p>Look, the reason I called you
is because I need a favor.
</p><timestamp>00:18:18</timestamp>
<p>Want me to leak a nude pic for charity?
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>I want you to sober up.
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p>First of all, rude. Second, gross.
And third, why?
</p><timestamp>00:18:25</timestamp>
<p>I have a very important job for you,
but if you're zonked out all the time,
</p><timestamp>00:18:29</timestamp>
<p>I'm not sure I can trust you
with the responsibility.
</p><timestamp>00:18:32</timestamp>
<p>No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:18:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sniffing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:36</timestamp>
<p>I said tomorrow, right?
</p><timestamp>00:18:38</timestamp>
<p>I've been working on this novel.
I wanna be remembered for something.
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>All I ever did was that stupid sitcom
that got ripped away from me.
</p><timestamp>00:18:45</timestamp>
<p>But now, with this book,
I have something good.
</p><timestamp>00:18:48</timestamp>
<p>I'm telling you, this book is gold.
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>-It's my Kazzaz-terpiece.
-Whoa.
</p><timestamp>00:18:54</timestamp>
<p>I want you to make sure
it gets published after I die.
</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>You can count on me.
</p><timestamp>00:18:59</timestamp>
<p>To life, huh? It'll kill you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:02</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, the gold is his manuscript.
</p><timestamp>00:19:05</timestamp>
<p>Herb made me promise
to get it published after he died.
</p><timestamp>00:19:08</timestamp>
<p>And you're just remembering this now?
</p><timestamp>00:19:10</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.
The ketamine's wearing off.
</p><timestamp>00:19:14</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, you were the other kid
on <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>
<p>That's why you've been following us
around all day.
</p><timestamp>00:19:20</timestamp>
<p>So no one's read this book
except for Henry Winkler
</p><timestamp>00:19:24</timestamp>
<p>-and now the book is missing?
-He must have been waiting for Herb to die
so he could steal the book
and publish it himself.
</p><timestamp>00:19:30</timestamp>
<p>But then when the cancer went
into remission--
</p><timestamp>00:19:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:19:34</timestamp>
<p>Guys, I don't think
that car crash was an accident.
</p><timestamp>00:19:36</timestamp>
<p>I think Herb might have been murdered!

</p><timestamp>00:19:40</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>huffing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:41</timestamp>
<p>What's going on?
</p><timestamp>00:19:42</timestamp>
<p>Something about a merger?
</p><timestamp>00:19:48</timestamp>
<p>My name's Toad, baby.
</p><timestamp>00:19:58</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:20:00</timestamp>
<p>Coolsville, daddy-o.
</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>Oh, lookie here.
</p><timestamp>00:20:06</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:20:08</timestamp>
<p>Yo! That's my bike!
</p><timestamp>00:20:11</timestamp>
<p>Oops. Did I do that?
</p><timestamp>00:20:16</timestamp>
<p>Damn. I know I should be mad,
but that guy's just so cool.
</p><timestamp>00:20:22</timestamp>
<p>And when the river finally stopped,
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>Herb went over
to a poor little Ottawan boy
and he said, "Son, you have water now."
</p><timestamp>00:20:29</timestamp>
<p>You know, a lot of people go their
whole lives and they never give a damn.
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>That was beautiful.
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>You clearly had a special relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>We were gonna sprinkle Herb
over the ocean,
but his resting place should be
someplace meaningful, don't you think?
</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you take this up to Ottawa
and spread his ashes there.
</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>And make sure you take a video,
and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.
</p><timestamp>00:20:53</timestamp>
<p>So we can always remember
your great friendship.
</p><timestamp>00:20:56</timestamp>
<p>Everybody, stop!
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>Henry Winkler is a stone-cold killer!
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:01</timestamp>
<p>What? I'm not a killer.
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>Unless you mean killer of gloom,
because I bring joy everywhere I go.
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>Did you mean "killer of gloom
because I bring joy everywhere I go"?
</p><timestamp>00:21:09</timestamp>
<p>You know that's not what I meant.
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>You murdered Herb
so you could publish his book.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>But we're not gonna let you
steal his legacy, Henry Winkler.
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>I was afraid this would happen.
</p><timestamp>00:21:21</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, no, he's got a gun!
-Oh, no!
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p>No, I have Herb's book.
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>I didn't kill Herb,
but I did steal his manuscript.
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>-So that I could burn it.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p>Because it's terrible.
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'll see for myself.
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>"The air in 1830s California was fragrant
with the flowers of laughter
and the smoke of adventure."
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Uh.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>After he died, Tina and I agreed
we couldn't let the book get published.
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>It would have turned Herb
into a laughingstock.
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>"The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.
</p><timestamp>00:21:57</timestamp>
<p>Hungry for crumpets.
But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life."
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>I know there's no accounting for taste,
but come on.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>He's right. Herb wanted a legacy,
but he already has one.
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>People loved <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
This would only ruin that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry I accused you of murder,
American TV legend Henry Winkler.
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>No need to apologize.
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death
to give it meaning.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>But there is no meaning in death.
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>That's why it's so terrifying.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>It was just easier to believe
that you killed him for his book
than believe that he just died
for nothing.
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>There is no shame in dying for nothing.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>That's why most people die.
</p><timestamp>00:22:38</timestamp>
<p>I just wanted to fix things somehow.
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, Horse Guy, but you can't.
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>Wow, heady stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>But let's not get distracted
from what a true friend
Princess Carolyn is.
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>Fantastic.
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>Hey. Special delivery.
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>Courtesy of the Toad-man.
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>Thanks. Hey, why'd you roll up
your sleeves like that? You look weird.
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I-- <subtitle>coughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>Well, you know, I was--
I was trying out a new look.
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p>It was-- It was a dumb idea.
</p><timestamp>00:23:23</timestamp>
<p>Yup. Whoa! Oh, no! Ow... Ow!
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p>-Here's your Squirt, sir.
-Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>And if that happens, I want you
to take care of each other.
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>No matter what,
we're going to stick together.
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p>-Congratulations!
-Hey, good job.
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>-You've got a goddamn hit on your hands.
-Anyone got coke?
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>ABC sent us limousines
to take us to the wrap party.
</p><timestamp>00:23:46</timestamp>
<p>I'm scared. I've never been in a limo.
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>Don't worry. We'll take care of you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>-Seriously, no one has coke?
-Let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p>You don't wanna go to the party?
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>Nah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:57</timestamp>
<p>Hey, we never got a chance
to walk around the lot.
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>Wanna check out that water tank
where they filmed <i>The Love Boat?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>Are you kidding? I've always wanted
to get tanked in a tank.
</p><timestamp>00:24:08</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
-Shh.
</p><timestamp>00:24:09</timestamp>
<p>-Quiet. Be careful.
-Oh, okay, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:24:13</timestamp>
<p>You ready?
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-What--? The water's only two inches deep.
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>
<p>Well, that's Hollywood for you.
</p><timestamp>00:24:23</timestamp>
<p>Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:24:24</timestamp>
<p>Are you scared at all?
</p><timestamp>00:24:27</timestamp>
<p>That if the show takes off,
everything's going to change?
</p><timestamp>00:24:31</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> No, I'm not scared, BJ.
The future is bright.
</p><timestamp>00:24:35</timestamp>
<p>Just look at it.
