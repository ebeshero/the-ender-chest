<p><subtitle>father</subtitle>
I thought these were salad plates.
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>mother</subtitle> Those are saucers.
<subtitle>father</subtitle> Why do we even have saucers?

<p>We don't drink tea.

<p>- You ruined me, BoJack.
- I know.
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>You better grow up to be something great

- I had to get rid of the old couch, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:03:21</timestamp>
<p>While I was sleeping on it?
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p>The couch was a metaphor

Maybe it was "my life so far."
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>I feel like
you could've woken me up first.
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>Todd, no one can wake anybody else up.
You need to wake yourself up.
</p><timestamp>00:03:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I don't know if I trust this new guy.
I'm just gonna go sleep in your car.

</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>FAB, stands for fresh active BNA.

- Hey, Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I gotta go.
One of my dumb-ass clients is here.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Just out for a jog, thought I'd say hello.
I jog now.
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>You jogged here from Laurel Canyon?
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>I drove, but I moved my arm a bunch,

<p>{\an8}Uh, someone named BoJark Hoseman
is here?
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>- Thank you, Stuart.
- Also, your coffee is coming late.
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>- Just like you ordered.
- I said "latte."
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ah. Well, I wrote down "late,"
so that's what it's gonna be.
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p>You mean, am I amped?
Because I am so pumped.
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>This <i>Secretariat </i>movie is a big deal.
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>Please do not blow it.
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Why would I blow it?
I have a brand-new attitude.
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You know, when I won that Golden Globe
last month, I went to a very dark place.
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>I was in a hole.
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>And I realized, "I can wallow
in this hole or I can change."
</p><timestamp>00:05:34</timestamp>
<p>While I was tempted to go with the former,
sometimes the only way out of a hole
is a latter.
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>- No pun intended.
- You clearly intended that pun.
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn,

</p><timestamp>00:05:46</timestamp>
<p>Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>- Uh-uh. I'm not asking.
- The awesome healing power--
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>- I am not asking.
- --of total positive energy.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>You should leave because
I'm about to pretend to get a phone call.

<p>Hello? <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
No, he's still here.

</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter, how the hell are you?

</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p>Uh...

<p>Diane, look at us.
A couple life-lovers over here.

<p>- Uh...
- Is that a new cone? Looking sharp, PB.
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>It is a new cone.
Is it obvious I'm wearing a cone?
</p><timestamp>00:07:13</timestamp>
<p>Didn't notice.
You've got the smile of a winner.
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>- What's going on?
- I have to wear the cone
so I don't gnaw on the stitches I had
to get when I punched a mirror last week.
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>I got drunk and thought my reflection
was another dog. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>

<p>- We've all been there.

Diane, is that you?

<p>Hey, why don't we just us two schedj

</p><timestamp>00:07:38</timestamp>
<p>"'Kend" is how I say weekend now.
</p><timestamp>00:07:40</timestamp>
<p>Uh, I love that. And I got a pair of tix
to the 'Stones show this 'kend.

<p>- Wanna go?
- The Rolling Stones?
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>What? Oh, no, no, no.
The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>I'm not really familiar with that outfit,
but I do love trying new things.
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>- Who are you?
- Anyway, we gotta get to work.
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>It was really great talking to you,
Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>And I need people
to witness me witnessing it.
</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>
<p>I know, and I'll be there in three months,
as soon as I'm done on the movie.
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>This is also important.
</p><timestamp>00:10:51</timestamp>
<p>In a way.
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>Well, lucky for you,
there'll still be just as much famine
and war and devastation
in three months.
</p><timestamp>00:10:58</timestamp>
<p>I'm not dead yet.
</p><timestamp>00:11:00</timestamp>
<p>- Yep. Lucky me.
- <subtitle>man</subtitle> We're still rolling, people.
</p><timestamp>00:11:03</timestamp>
<p>So, BoJack, in this scene,
Secretariat is sad, right?
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>Afraid he's gonna lose his scholarship.
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>Oh, sure. Yeah, sad. Of course. Duh.
<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>Okay, here we go. Action.
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Secretariat.
</p><timestamp>00:11:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>campy</subtitle> What are you doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>That was bad. I know that was bad.
Let's keep it rolling.
</p><timestamp>00:11:21</timestamp>
<p>- I'll say when to keep rolling.
- Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:11:23</timestamp>
<p>What are you doing here? Did we get it?
I can tell by your face that we didn't.
</p><timestamp>00:11:28</timestamp>
<p>All right, let me try again.
What are you doing--?
</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>I am having trouble with the words.
Is it okay if I play around with it a bit?
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>When did you get here?
Sorry, no. Got it. Got it. Got it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>Man, these lights are bright, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>Can we kill these lights at all?
Is that a--?
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>- No.
- Okay, I'm sad.
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>I'm sad. Acting sad.
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>Secretariat is sad.
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>Okay, here we go.
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>I'm sad!
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, what was the line?
</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p>I don't know if this helps or not,
but when Secretariat was a kid
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p>- he actually--
- Aah!
</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p>- My face!
- <subtitle>man 1</subtitle> Hey, hey.
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>- Whoa, whoa!
- <subtitle>man 2</subtitle> Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:12:01</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man 3</subtitle> Watch out!
<subtitle>man 4</subtitle> Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man 5 gasps</subtitle>
<subtitle>man 6</subtitle> Whoa, whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>PA</subtitle> Oh, my God. My face.
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>My beautiful face.
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>Why didn't someone tell me
not to trip over that cable?
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>It was such an important job,
but no one was there to do it
and now my face is in ruins.
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>We're gonna need a couple of days
to rebuild this set.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>So, let's all just use this time
to regroup
and really figure out what we're doing
and why we're here.
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>audience laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>So, let me get this straight.
Bad means good?
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p>Maybe you should leave the teen-talk
to me. Jeezy Kableezy.
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>audience laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>Well, it wasn't Ibsen.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>That's your takeaway?
That your son's TV show wasn't Ibsen?
</p><timestamp>00:12:56</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. Did you need a compliment?
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I loved the part where you got
your head caught in the banister.
</p><timestamp>00:13:02</timestamp>
<p>- Yeah--
- And what's this letter I have?
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p>It's from the government saying,
"I'm proud of you."
</p><timestamp>00:13:07</timestamp>
<p>- Are you--?
- No, what I'm holding is nothing.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>Can you check on our drinks?
I would love some gin.
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>I wouldn't drink anything out of an open
container. This town is full of AIDS.
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>- That's not--
- You're a clown, you know that?
</p><timestamp>00:13:19</timestamp>
<p>You've always been a pillar of support.
</p><timestamp>00:13:21</timestamp>
<p>Gin, please? Is there gin coming?
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>I'm here, aren't I?
I suffered through that ordeal.
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>You know, the man sitting next to me
was wearing a T-shirt?
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>A T-shirt, BoJack, in the theater.
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p>Yes, a T-shirt.
</p><timestamp>00:13:32</timestamp>
<p>Worst thing that's happened to anyone
in a theater.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>- The T-shirt told me to "just do it."
- Here we go.
</p><timestamp>00:13:38</timestamp>
<p>I don't know to what "it"
the T-shirt referred
but I won't be spoken to in that tone
by an article of clothing.
</p><timestamp>00:13:44</timestamp>
<p>Vodka? Triple sec?
Looking for any alcohol.
</p><timestamp>00:13:46</timestamp>
<p>You don't know how lucky you are.
</p><timestamp>00:13:48</timestamp>
<p>I hope you die before I do so you never
know what it's like to lose a mother.
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p>As long as one of us dies,
that's good enough.
</p><timestamp>00:13:54</timestamp>
<p>Can we please get some alcohol
into my mouth?

<p>- Hey, do you wanna talk?
- Talk? Why? Why would we do that?
</p><timestamp>00:14:20</timestamp>
<p>So you can put everything
in a book and sell a million copies?
</p><timestamp>00:14:23</timestamp>
<p>Wow. Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:14:25</timestamp>
<p>That's what the old me would have said.
The new me doesn't hold a grudge.
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>phone rings</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p>- No.
- I gotta say,
the new you seems a little on edge.
</p><timestamp>00:14:33</timestamp>
<p>What? Me?
I'm as cool as The Fonz in a meat locker.
</p><timestamp>00:14:35</timestamp>
<p>That's a metaphor, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:14:37</timestamp>
<p>- It's a simile.
- Goddamn it.

<p><subtitle>phone rings</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:40</timestamp>
<p>Oh, okay. Hello?
</p><timestamp>00:14:41</timestamp>
<p>Small talk, small talk, small talk.
Are you blowing it?
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>- I heard you're blowing it.
- What? Who told you that? Was it Todd?
</p><timestamp>00:14:48</timestamp>
<p>You gotta turn this ship around, BoJ.
If you don't--
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>
<p>Hey, can you hold on a second?
I'm getting another call.
</p><timestamp>00:14:53</timestamp>
<p>Well, if it isn't my friend, Rutabaga,
the boy prince of the 26th floor.
</p><timestamp>00:14:58</timestamp>
<p>Carolyn.
How are things all the way up on 27?
</p><timestamp>00:15:02</timestamp>
<p>Stomp once for good, twice for killing it.
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>Killing...
</p><timestamp>00:15:08</timestamp>
<p>Give me some gossip.
</p><timestamp>00:15:10</timestamp>
<p>My wife is making me go
to the opera tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:15:12</timestamp>
<p>I need something to distract me
from the thought of D-bags
singing songs in German
about their boners.
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p>Okay, you gotta
keep this close to the vest
but I am inches
from getting Emily VanCamp
the lead in Goose Van Sant's
new movie about Jackie O.
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>My clients would f-l-ip
if I got them parts like that.
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>You're killing it
in the department of kicking ass
in regards to you being an agent
and being good at it, crushing it.
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>
<p>You're not so bad yourself, Rutabaga,
for a 26er. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:41</timestamp>
<p>You're the only one in this building
who isn't a total snooze-cooze.
</p><timestamp>00:15:45</timestamp>
<p>Yes, Natasha, I'm talking about you.
I know you're listening.
</p><timestamp>00:15:49</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. I gotta go. I made Natasha cry.
</p><timestamp>00:15:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:54</timestamp>
<p>I don't think she's coming back.
</p><timestamp>00:15:56</timestamp>
<p>Could we keep it down
in the front, please?
</p><timestamp>00:15:59</timestamp>
<p>- Thank you.
- What am I gonna do?
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p>Well, you were an actor for nine years
on <i>Horsin' Around. </i>How did you do that?
</p><timestamp>00:16:06</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>- Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Of course, buddy.
</p><timestamp>00:16:10</timestamp>
<p>I always have time for you,
my good friend BoJack
in this, the year 1988.
</p><timestamp>00:16:15</timestamp>
<p>Have a seat.
</p><timestamp>00:16:16</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>stomping overhead</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>
<p>Hey, enough with the stomping already!
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>- Am I-- Am I a clown?
- Oh, brother.
</p><timestamp>00:16:25</timestamp>
<p>Didn't I tell you not to invite your mom
to the taping?
</p><timestamp>00:16:27</timestamp>
<p>As Max Headroom would say,
"Your m-m-mom is a b-b-bitch." <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:32</timestamp>
<p>But I am a good actor, right?
</p><timestamp>00:16:34</timestamp>
<p>BJ, I don't know. Look--
You know what you're good at?
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>
<p>Hitting your mark, saying your lines,
loudly with good diction.
</p><timestamp>00:16:42</timestamp>
<p>Should I be doing more?
To capture the character
</p><timestamp>00:16:44</timestamp>
<p>- and make the audience connect?
- This is a situation comedy.
</p><timestamp>00:16:48</timestamp>
<p>No one watches this show to feel feelings.
Life is depressing enough already.
</p><timestamp>00:16:52</timestamp>
<p>You bring joy to millions of people.
</p><timestamp>00:16:54</timestamp>
<p>Maybe someday later,
you'll need to learn how to act for real.
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p>But for now,
<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> don't worry about it.
</p><timestamp>00:17:02</timestamp>
<p>Oh, shit. I'm not an actor.
</p><timestamp>00:17:06</timestamp>
<p>All this time, I assumed there was more
to me than everyone thought
but maybe there isn't.
</p><timestamp>00:17:12</timestamp>
<p>That's the part where you're supposed
to disagree with me.
</p><timestamp>00:17:14</timestamp>
<p>Oh, right.
</p><timestamp>00:17:16</timestamp>
<p>Well, you got the part, didn't you?
What did you do in the audition?
</p><timestamp>00:17:20</timestamp>
<p>Well, how should I know?
That was the old me.
</p><timestamp>00:17:22</timestamp>
<p>Now I've got a brand-new attitude.
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God. Okay. Okay.
What should I do?
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico?
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>Start a new life there?
Meet a local girl? Fall in love?
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>Talk my way into a job at a textile plant?
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>Work my way up until I own the place?
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>What am I talking about?
I can't run a textile plant.
</p><timestamp>00:17:39</timestamp>
<p>Too much responsibility. What am I
gonna do? The walls are closing in!
</p><timestamp>00:17:43</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, breathe. You can do this.
</p><timestamp>00:17:46</timestamp>
<p>You have two days.
Maybe you could hire an acting coach.
</p><timestamp>00:17:49</timestamp>
<p>- Yeah?
- Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:17:50</timestamp>
<p>Plus, you can watch old
Secretariat videos.
</p><timestamp>00:17:53</timestamp>
<p>I've got a hard drive full of research.
</p><timestamp>00:17:55</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. I can do this.
</p><timestamp>00:17:58</timestamp>
<p>I've got two whole days.
</p><timestamp>00:18:00</timestamp>
<p>And when the pressure's on,
that's when I shine.
</p><timestamp>00:18:03</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Two days.
I can do all those things.
</p><timestamp>00:18:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh, shit. I didn't do any of those things.
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>- What are you doing here?
- Ah!
</p><timestamp>00:18:16</timestamp>
<p>That was it. Say that again.
</p><timestamp>00:18:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>campy</subtitle> What are you doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:18:20</timestamp>
<p>- Okay.
- No?
</p><timestamp>00:18:21</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, before we get started
</p><timestamp>00:18:23</timestamp>
<p>- I wanted to show you this.
- What?
</p><timestamp>00:18:25</timestamp>
<p>This is the machine
that's gonna make you a good actor.
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>
<p>- Really?
- No. We need to make a scan of your face
so that if you die,
we can finish the movie.
</p><timestamp>00:18:33</timestamp>
<p>Standard procedure. When a star
is assessed to be of a certain liability,
like if there was a whole book written
about what a reckless jackass he is,
you make a digital replica so you're
not screwed if he goes all Belushi on you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:45</timestamp>
<p>- Wait, which Belushi?
- Hold still, please.
</p><timestamp>00:18:48</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>whirring</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:50</timestamp>
<p>- Terrific. We got it.
- One day, that's gonna be the job.
</p><timestamp>00:18:53</timestamp>
<p>Sit for five seconds
while a machine scans his face.
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>
<p>Six months later,
plugging a movie on <i>Kimmel.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>I gotta go on <i>Kimmel </i>now?
What if he makes me read a mean tweet?
</p><timestamp>00:19:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm not emotionally prepared.
</p><timestamp>00:19:03</timestamp>
<p>Don't worry so much.
If you can't do this part
we'll just fire you and get someone else
who can. Either way, I'll be fine.
</p><timestamp>00:19:10</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>groans</subtitle>
- What do you need, BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:19:12</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. I thought I wanted this,
but now I'm feeling all this pressure.
</p><timestamp>00:19:16</timestamp>
<p>- Think you made a mistake, hiring me?
- I don't make mistakes, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:19:20</timestamp>
<p>I do the crossword in Sharpie,
I never learned the shortcut for undo.
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p>- Command-Z.
- Don't need it, won't use it.
</p><timestamp>00:19:26</timestamp>
<p>I'm trying to have this new attitude,
be this better, more positive guy.
</p><timestamp>00:19:30</timestamp>
<p>I keep thinking about how this movie
is my last shot at happiness.
</p><timestamp>00:19:33</timestamp>
<p>Well, BoJack, I hope this helps:
</p><timestamp>00:19:35</timestamp>
<p>I don't care if you are happy or not.
</p><timestamp>00:19:39</timestamp>
<p>You have a job to do.
</p><timestamp>00:19:40</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Kelsey chuckles</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:19:51</timestamp>
<p>- Hey, Diane, you're a writer, aren't you?
- Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:19:53</timestamp>
<p>Yes. I am a writer. What do you need?
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>Can you write on a sign
"watch out for cable"?
</p><timestamp>00:19:59</timestamp>
<p>You were telling people,
but it's a really important job
and a sign is less likely
to get distracted.
</p><timestamp>00:20:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Yeah. Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:20:07</timestamp>
<p>What are <i>you</i> doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:20:09</timestamp>
<p>What are you doing <i>here?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p>What <i>are</i> you doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:20:12</timestamp>
<p>- What are you doing here?
- So, I went a little overboard
and I made you two mixes.
</p><timestamp>00:20:17</timestamp>
<p>The first CD is all Mighty Mighty.
</p><timestamp>00:20:19</timestamp>
<p>The second CD is all of the Bosstones'
side projects and solo singles.
</p><timestamp>00:20:22</timestamp>
<p>Listen to it and imagine the band
never took that hiatus
in the mid-aughts
when America briefly lost interest in ska.
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>I don't have time.
I don't wanna listen to your music.
</p><timestamp>00:20:31</timestamp>
<p>I don't wanna hang out.
Get out of here.
</p><timestamp>00:20:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:34</timestamp>
<p>All right. You don't wanna listen
to Bosstones together.
</p><timestamp>00:20:37</timestamp>
<p>That's the impression that I get.
</p><timestamp>00:20:39</timestamp>
<p>- Is it the impression that I get?
- Yes. That's the impression that you get.
</p><timestamp>00:20:43</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Todd yawns</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:44</timestamp>

<p>BoJack, listen, I know you're scared,
but it's gonna be okay.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>- You gotta be strong.
- Yeah, but--
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>You gotta rise to the occasion, okay?
So what if the new couch is weird?
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>- Or lumpy?
- Uh, what?
</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>What are you gonna do?
Just sleep in BoJack's car forever?
</p><timestamp>00:21:08</timestamp>
<p>- Are you talking to me, or you--?
- Damn it, time to stop being a coward.
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>It's time to go home
and sleep on BoJack's couch. Hurray!

<p>Charley Witherspoon, 28th floor agent.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>Charley. Listen, I wanted to touch base
about Emily's start date on Jackie O.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah. Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>Well, we got some new screen tests
and, uh, Goose decided to go
in a different direction.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>Are you saying the Van Sant camp
wants to recant on VanCamp?
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>Because they can't.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>Charley, you better get your client
to change his mind
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>- or I'll walk up to the 28th floor and--
- Just kidding.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>- I can't get to the phone right now.
- What?
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>This is one of those answering machines
that sounds like it's Charley talking
but it's actually
just an answering machine.
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>- I know you're there, Charley.
- Leave a message.
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>- I'm not gonna leave a message.

</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Charley, Princess Carolyn again.
Listen--

<p>Okay. Can I please just tell you
about the opera, though?
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>- How did you like the opera?
- I loved it.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>Loved Tristan, loved Isolde,
cried like a bunny.
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>Listen, my brain has been a-buzzing
for the past few days
thinking about that Jackie O movie.
</p><timestamp>00:22:45</timestamp>
<p>I know it's your baby,
but I did make a few calls
and got my Rooney a screen test.
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>I put that movie together for my client.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>No, no, no, don't freak out.
It's just a screen test.
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
<p>But, honestly,
how fantaj would my Rooney be
as a young Jackie Bouv?
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>Stomp once for so fantaj,
twice for stupid-fantaj.
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>Carolyn? I only heard one stomp.
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Carolyn, I heart you.
You're beautiful.

anyone wants to buy a book about him.
