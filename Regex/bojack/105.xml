Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>I'm actually a huge celebrity
on my way to New York
for an important meeting
with a book publisher,
who wants to publish a book
about me because I am famous.

</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>I followed the basic

<p>Really? You've never heard

</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p>You know very well who I am.
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>

<p>Always nice to get a change

<p>{\an8}I think the New York air's

<p>{\an8}She's too good.

<p>- I was thinking late September.
- I am so sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>It's fine, he was old
and also the worst.

<p>{\an8}Such a terrible tragedy

<p>{\an8}really puts everything

</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Where does that leave us

</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Not a problem.

<p>Hey, so listen,

<p>I really want to be here for you

but I'm not really good

or families or feelings
or people.
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>Don't worry.
You can wait in the car.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>It's probably better
you don't meet my brothers.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>They're narrow-minded,
mean-spirited dirtbags.

brothers growing up.

<p>Daddy, do you want to meet
my imaginary friend?
</p><timestamp>00:06:16</timestamp>
<p>Imaginary friends
are freeloaders
invented by communists
to rip-off welfare.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you do
something productive,
like bang your head
against the wall
until your brain
isn't so stupid?
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>Okay, Daddy.
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, well, I
was pretty lonely, too.
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>My family made
my life miserable,
and then they never
forgave me for leaving.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>So, what,
you're like the black sheep?
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>No, Gary's the black sheep.
He's adopted.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm just the member of
the family nobody likes.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>And my dad
was the worst of them all.
</p><timestamp>00:06:39</timestamp>
<p>You told me
that you and your father
used to sit on the roof
and look at the stars together.
</p><timestamp>00:06:43</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah, I was just trying
to get you to open up,
so I used an old writer's trick
called "me lying to you."
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm using an old me trick
called
"that hurts my feelings."
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p>And the truth is,
I used to sit alone
on the hill out by the dump
and dream of waking up
as Chelsea Clinton,
but with my hair.
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>You do have great hair.
</p><timestamp>00:07:00</timestamp>
<p>I know.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>distant sirens</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>That's us.

<p>I'll just pop in
for a quick hi and bye.
</p><timestamp>00:07:07</timestamp>
<p>Then we'll be on our way.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>Ten minutes, swear to God.
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>

A kaleidoscope?

</p><timestamp>00:08:41</timestamp>
<p>Ah, don't go.

<p>Deedee, please.
</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>

<p>Ain't that right, Marty?
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>Can't look up from the game.

<p>Besides, we need your help

<p>Yeah, try 1-800-The-Internet,

<p>Oh, my God.

</p><timestamp>00:09:11</timestamp>
<p>That was before

<p>Hey, BoJack, you ever meet

</p><timestamp>00:12:00</timestamp>
<p>Well, one time
at Bristol Farms,
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>Ben Affleck and I did reach
for the same bunch of grapes.
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>Oh, he eats grapes
just like us?
</p><timestamp>00:12:08</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Ma,
Ben Affleck eats grapes.
</p><timestamp>00:12:10</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Ma</subtitle> He don't eat grapes!
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>BoJack said
he fed Affleck grapes.
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>He was graping it up
with the Daredevil himself.
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p>This is the greatest day
of my life.
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:12:21</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I don't suppose you boys
would have any interest
in maybe playing some
touch football later?
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>Are you kidding?
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>Touch football
with a star like you?
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>That would be
mad wicked pisser.
</p><timestamp>00:12:30</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, you know what else
we got to do?
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>We got to watch
the Cryane video.
</p><timestamp>00:12:34</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, that sounds good.
What's that?
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p>No, we don't need
to revisit that.
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>When Deedee was 16,
we made up a secret pen pal
for her named Leo.
</p><timestamp>00:12:42</timestamp>
<p>Guys, I really would rather
not discuss it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>We all took turns
writing her letters,
pretending to be this sensitive
boy from Cambridge.
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>It was wicked messed up.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>"Oh, Diane, we're
two misunderstood souls.
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>Everyone else is a phony.
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p>Yours forever, Leo."
</p><timestamp>00:13:00</timestamp>
<p>What?
That is amazing.
</p><timestamp>00:13:02</timestamp>
<p>After six months of letters,
we hired a homeless guy
to pretend to be Leo
and take her
to the homecoming dance.
</p><timestamp>00:13:09</timestamp>
<p>- Look at her.
- Watch, watch this part.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>I like your boutonnière.

</p><timestamp>00:13:12</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:13:14</timestamp>
<p>Why don't we watch this
every day?
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>- Look at her face.
- Now that's a good prank.
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>I was humiliated.
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, you wouldn't get it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:21</timestamp>
<p>It's a brothers thing,
right, brothers?
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>Whoo!
That's Cryane for you.
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>What a pussy.
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>You know,
it's nice that years later
we can all laugh about this.
</p><timestamp>00:13:30</timestamp>
<p>Yep, my therapist
thinks the same thing.
</p><timestamp>00:13:32</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna go meet
with the funeral director.
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>Any of you boys
want to come?
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>Nah, I ain't so big
on funeral homes, Deedee.
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>All them dead bodies,
they give me the jeebies.
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, Deedee,
why do we got to go?
</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>
<p>Fine, none of you
have to go.
</p><timestamp>00:13:43</timestamp>
<p>I'll take care of everything.
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>Thank you, Diane.
We all really appreciate it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>Come on, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:13:48</timestamp>
<p>Why you got to take
BoJack with you?
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>- Boo!

<p>Boo!

<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Hey!

</p><timestamp>00:13:57</timestamp>
<p>I must go now, but I'll see
you all at the funeral, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>And when I do,
you're all getting noogies.
</p><timestamp>00:14:02</timestamp>
<p>- Funeral!

<p>Tell me about your father.
</p><timestamp>00:14:32</timestamp>
<p>Well, he was a mean,
sadistic alcoholic,
who never supported
anything I did
and actively delighted
in seeing me fail.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>Hmm, I see.
</p><timestamp>00:14:41</timestamp>
<p>Sounds like you're looking for
our Piece of Shit Dad Package.
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>That would be too good

</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:14:55</timestamp>
<p>Excellent choice.
</p><timestamp>00:14:58</timestamp>
<p>Hey, can I suggest
something?
</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>You might want to loosen up
a little.
</p><timestamp>00:15:02</timestamp>
<p>I think you could actually
learn a thing or two
from your brothers.
</p><timestamp>00:15:05</timestamp>
<p>Are you kidding?
</p><timestamp>00:15:07</timestamp>

nothing would ever get done.

<p>Ugh, how are we supposed
to blackmail him

</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>Maybe we got to get him

<p>Plus the men's lav

even do that.
</p><timestamp>00:17:07</timestamp>
<p>Where's the body even?
</p><timestamp>00:17:08</timestamp>
<p>Beg your pardon,
minor hiccup.
</p><timestamp>00:17:11</timestamp>
<p>My goons went to pick your
father up, but nobody was home.
</p><timestamp>00:17:15</timestamp>
<p>For a nominal fee,
we can scrounge up
another body for you.
</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>Would you care to peruse
our loaner closet?
</p><timestamp>00:17:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>upbeat music</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>Hey, assholes!
Where were you?
</p><timestamp>00:17:27</timestamp>
<p>I planned the whole funeral,
like you asked me to,
and nobody showed.
</p><timestamp>00:17:31</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, we realized dad
wouldn't have wanted
some stuffy funeral.
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>He would've wanted his body
to be chopped up into chum
and thrown
in Derek Jeter's fat face.
</p><timestamp>00:17:39</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, suck it, Jeter!
</p><timestamp>00:17:41</timestamp>
<p>Wait, what?
Where is Dad?
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>We got him chummed.
He's in the truck.
</p><timestamp>00:17:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>horn honks</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:46</timestamp>
<p>You chummed Dad?
</p><timestamp>00:17:48</timestamp>
<p>It's what your father wanted,
honey,
but then you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?
</p><timestamp>00:17:53</timestamp>
<p>Let me get this straight.
</p><timestamp>00:17:55</timestamp>
<p>So instead of coming
to the funeral
that I paid for
and spent all day organizing,
you had Dad's body
ground into chum,
so you could throw his mushy
remains on Derek Jeter?
</p><timestamp>00:18:06</timestamp>
<p>No, not just on Derek Jeter.
</p><timestamp>00:18:08</timestamp>
<p>We're gonna throw it
into his fat face.
</p><timestamp>00:18:10</timestamp>
<p>- Yeah, his fat face.
- In his fat face.

</p><timestamp>00:18:15</timestamp>
<p>Tommy, you begged me
to stay and help.
</p><timestamp>00:18:17</timestamp>
<p>Why does everything always
got to be about big-shot Diane?
</p><timestamp>00:18:21</timestamp>
<p>Too good for her home.
</p><timestamp>00:18:23</timestamp>
<p>I don't think
I'm too good for my home.
</p><timestamp>00:18:25</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, guys,
you got it all wrong.
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>
<p>Diane isn't a big-shot.
She's my ghostwriter.
</p><timestamp>00:18:30</timestamp>
<p>She's writing a book that's not
even gonna have her name on it.
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>You think this
is how she expected
her life would be going at 34?
</p><timestamp>00:18:37</timestamp>
<p>She lives with her rich
boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.
</p><timestamp>00:18:41</timestamp>
<p>She's not too good
for anything.
</p><timestamp>00:18:44</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p>Diane's a freeloader?

<p>Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.
</p><timestamp>00:19:09</timestamp>
<p>Diane, you are making
a public spectacle of yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:19:13</timestamp>
<p>Deedee, what are you doing
with Dad's keys?
</p><timestamp>00:19:15</timestamp>
<p>Put those back.
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>
<p>Oh, come on,

<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> Suck a dick, dumb shits!
</p><timestamp>00:19:24</timestamp>
<p>Well, that crazy clam did it.
She took Pops.
</p><timestamp>00:19:26</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no,

<p>Ah, she used to run off

</p><timestamp>00:19:43</timestamp>

<p>I don't know,

</p><timestamp>00:19:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh, don't go, BoJack.

</p><timestamp>00:20:00</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, don't leave, bro.

<p>The amazing thing is,

<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> <i>Not good.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:37</timestamp>
<p>I should've known
it was a waste of time

</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's awful.
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>Well, when you get back,
</p><timestamp>00:20:43</timestamp>

<p>You know

</p><timestamp>00:20:51</timestamp>
<p>I have to go.
BoJack's here.
</p><timestamp>00:20:53</timestamp>
<p><i>BoJack, well,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>Hey, sorry I said
all that stuff about you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>It's all true, isn't it?
</p><timestamp>00:21:01</timestamp>
<p>I found this letter
back at the bar.
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>I think it's for you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>Look, just read it.
I think you'll like it.
</p><timestamp>00:21:08</timestamp>
<p>"Dear Diane, it's me,
your old pen pal Leo.
</p><timestamp>00:21:13</timestamp>
<p>This definitely isn't
BoJack Horseman writing this."
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>Keep reading.
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>"You're a good person,
Diane,
and that's
the most important thing.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>Even if no one
appreciates you,
it's important that
you don't stop being good.
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p>I like how you always
bring your own bags
to the grocery store,
and how you're always
organized to go places.
</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>I like how you chew gum on the
airplane so your ears will pop.
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p>A lot of people might not
appreciate that about you,
but I do.
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p>Yours forever, Leo."
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>That's the best letter
he ever wrote me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>Look, take it from someone
with his own shitty parents,
family is a sinkhole,
and you were right to get out
when you had the chance.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>The stupid thing is,
even now I still just want them
to be proud of me
and think I did good.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>Is that really stupid?
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>- Yep.
- No, it isn't.
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, it is.
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>You want those guys
to be proud of you?
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>I guess I was just hoping to
get some modicum of closure.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>Closure is a made up thing
by Steven Spielberg
to sell movie tickets.
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>It, like true love
and the Munich Olympics,
doesn't exist
in the real world.
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>The only thing to do now
is just to keep living forward.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but every time
I come back here they--
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>So don't come back here.
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>What's great about Los Angeles
is nobody cares about where
you're from or who you are.
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p>It's a superficial town
where you can worry
about stupid shit
like keeping your pool clean,
and what artisanal nuts
to put on your salad.
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>I do like salad.
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>Oh, it's the best.

<p>Why do you think people keep
moving there?
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>Thanks, BoJack.
