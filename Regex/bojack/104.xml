<p>And I say, "Hey, buddy,
I can't help it."

<p>{\an8}You get that? Long face.

<p>Felt like that flew

<p>They'll laugh.

<p>Why are you giving me
advice?
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>Look, I've been doing stand-up

<p>Don't know what that means.

<p>Well, I was talking

</p><timestamp>00:02:56</timestamp>
<p>- Who's Wayne?
- I'm Wayne.
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Wayne's writing an article

</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>BuzzFeed?</i>

<p>We're the same!
</p><timestamp>00:03:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}How could you think that
that's the same?
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}My book will be in libraries
for hundreds of years.
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Your <i>BuzzFeed</i> article
will be crammed
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}between an animated GIF

<p>{\an8}and a list of fun facts
about <i>Legally Blonde.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:24</timestamp>
<p>Ha! Classic Zoe.
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>I still don't know
what that means.
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>Well, are you familiar
with <i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Do you mean his sitcom
that coincidentally
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}had the exact same premise
as my sitcom?
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>Not the exact same.
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House </i>
featured a pair of twins,
Zoe and Zelda.
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p><i>Zelda was the sunny,</i>
<i>fun-loving extrovert.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:42</timestamp>
<p>Look at my pumpkin,
Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>Pretty smile, Zelly-belly.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>audience</subtitle> Aww...
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p><i>Whereas Zoe was the smart,</i>
<i>cynical introvert.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>My pumpkin's throwing up
because Halloween
encourages excessive consumption
of refined sugar
at a time when obesity rates
are sky high.
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>Plus, Halloween costumes are
a gateway to casual racism.

<p>Now, was the show's acting
ham-fisted
and the writing moronic?
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>N-n-no?
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yes, but the Zoe/Zelda
paradigm rang true.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>I believe everyone's
either a Zoe or a Zelda.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}For example, Nixon was a Zoe
and Kennedy, a Zelda.
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>Al Gore, Zoe.
George W. Bush, total Zelda.
</p><timestamp>00:04:25</timestamp>
<p>It's R2-D2 and C-3PO,
Zooey and Emily Deschanel.
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>So Zooey's a Zoe?
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No, Zooey's a Zelda.
Emily's the Zoe.
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>What a crazy world.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>So which one are you,
BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>I think I'm...
above this.
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>Said the Zoe.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>Well, I think I'm a Zelda.
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Or maybe you're
the third kind of person,
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}whose only function is to drain
the energy and life force
from his host organism.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>Come on, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>Nah, he's right.
I'm pretty much worthless.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>See? You say something
to someone enough times,
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and eventually,
he internalizes it.
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The system works.
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>I don't have a job,
I don't have any prospects.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I probably won't ever finish
the rock opera I'm working on.
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What?
<subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Since when are you
working on a rock opera?
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no.
Why'd I ask that?
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>Basically, it's <i>Tommy</i>
by way of <i>Cirque du Soleil</i>
set in space,
with heavy erotic overtones,
and the gripping psychodrama
of a thriller
with plenty of heart
and more than a little humor.

</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>Let's skip that one
for a minute.
</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p>Tell me about Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>Todd?
What's to tell?
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>Five years ago, he found his way
into one of my house parties
and never left.
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>And you've never asked him
anything about himself?
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>I've asked him to get a job,
I've asked him to move out.
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>With a little encouragement,
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>I'll bet he could
really flourish.
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>I mean, didn't you have anyone
who helped you
when you were just
starting out?
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>Um, actually, no.
</p><timestamp>00:07:21</timestamp>
<p>Todd clearly thinks
the world of you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>Todd thinks the world
of Pop-Tarts.
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>Look, I get that helping other
people is not your thing, but--
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>What? I let Todd live
rent-free in my stately manse.
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>I am his own personal
Mother Teresa.
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>But do you let him stay here
because you're kind
or just because you're terrified
of being alone?
</p><timestamp>00:07:36</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughing</subtitle>
That is insane!
</p><timestamp>00:07:38</timestamp>
<p>I would love to be alone.
That is all I want.
</p><timestamp>00:07:42</timestamp>
<p>Mmm...if that were
really true,
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>I don't think you'd be clipping
Todd's wings all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>What? That's unbelievable.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>Todd!
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>What?
Clean up my shit?
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>Yes, but also,
I would like to...
help you with your
dumb-ass rock opera.
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>- What?
- I am... supporting you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>I-I don't understand.
Oh, my God, are you dying?
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>No. I... think you have great
depth of untapped potential
and I wish to mentor you
in your... art.
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>- Really?
- Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:08:11</timestamp>
<p>Wait, is this going to be
like that time
you promised to take me
ice skating,
and I got really excited
about the ice skating,
but then instead of ice skating,
you left me at home
so you could go
to the strip club
and then you took the strippers
ice skating?
</p><timestamp>00:08:22</timestamp>
<p>- No.
- Then hooray!
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>Let's dig in.
Where to start?
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, the headline is,
I hate it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:32</timestamp>
<p>I hate everything about it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p>The premise is bad
and the execution is also bad.
</p><timestamp>00:08:35</timestamp>
<p>It's an irredeemable jumble
of shit.
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p>Tough but fair.
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>Ahem.

<p>That said,
I don't see why
we can't make something
really great here.
</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>- has been destroyed?
- No.
</p><timestamp>00:09:06</timestamp>
<p>Well, what if we move that
to the fourth act?
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>I have no idea
what you're talking about,
but that idea is terrible.

than your rock opera.
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p>That's not really a note.
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>In fact, none of your notes
have been notes.
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>I feel like you're
not even listening.
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, well, you know what?
Maybe I would listen
if the Turbidians
had some reason
to enter
the Cave of Swollen Dreams
that didn't break the pact
they made in act one
with Queen Darneesa.
</p><timestamp>00:09:51</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:09:53</timestamp>
<p>The Turbidians
are a loyal people.
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>They-- they wouldn't
betray their queen.
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>Unless...

<p><subtitle>both</subtitle> They were working
for Queen Darneesa,
who gave them a potion
that would counteract
the effects of
the Elixir of Failed Remembrance
so they could bring
the secret knowledge
from the cave back to her,
and then establish Newtopia
as a vassal state
to the Craterman kingdom!

</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>Wait, you want
to get lunch with me?
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, that's right.
</p><timestamp>00:10:56</timestamp>
<p>Is this like the time
you invited me to lunch,
but then, when I got
to the restaurant,
you texted me to tell me
you weren't coming
because you were at a strip club
"eating stripper" for lunch,
and also,
it was my birthday?
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>No.
</p><timestamp>00:11:10</timestamp>
<p>Then hooray!
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>And that was a last time
I worked with David O. Russell.
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>What's that old expression?
</p><timestamp>00:11:20</timestamp>
<p>"Fool me once, shame on me,
but fool me twice...
fiddle-dee-dee."
</p><timestamp>00:11:24</timestamp>
<p>I do believe
that is the expression.

</p><timestamp>00:11:28</timestamp>
<p>Erica, I don't have time
to be charmed to death
right now.
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>So how long have you been
dating Mr. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>Is it serious?
I'm only asking for the article.
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>Better question:
How long does it take
to write a <i>BuzzFeed</i> article?
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>I want to be thorough.
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>What? Diane, Diane,
Diane, Diane!
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>- Do you know what today is?
- Sunday?
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>It's "burritos as big as your head" day
at El Taco Loco!
</p><timestamp>00:11:50</timestamp>
<p>We gotta go right now!
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>I thought we were going to see
the Diane Arbus show
at LACMA today.
You know I love Diane Arbus.
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
I see what's happening here.
</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p>Her name is Diane,
and your name is Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>That's not what's happening.
</p><timestamp>00:12:04</timestamp>
<p>I can go to the Arbus show
with you, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>I've actually been meaning
to go myself.
</p><timestamp>00:12:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh, man, you guys
are perfect for each other.
</p><timestamp>00:12:10</timestamp>
<p>Why did you ever break up?
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>nervous laugh</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>Okay, less yakking,

</p><timestamp>00:12:21</timestamp>
<p>- Uh, sorry.
- Mm-hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>You mean to tell me
that for a full year
you were on the run
from the Russian mafia?
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>Well,<i> </i>a Russian mafia.
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>I can't believe you never
told me any of this stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>I just thought you were
a dumb freeloader
who ate all my food
and played video games all day.
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p>You should have seen me
in high school.
</p><timestamp>00:12:38</timestamp>
<p>There was this one game,
Decapathon.
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>I remember that game.
</p><timestamp>00:12:42</timestamp>
<p>I was up for Dr. Decapitator
in the movie version.
</p><timestamp>00:12:44</timestamp>
<p>They said they wanted
someone hipper,
but the part ended up
going to Robert Downey.
</p><timestamp>00:12:47</timestamp>
<p>- Junior?
- If it was Junior,
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>I would have said, "Junior."
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>That game basically
destroyed my life.
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>I flunked out of school,
my girlfriend left me.
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>I mean,
I didn't stop playing
until my mom
threw me out of the house.
</p><timestamp>00:13:00</timestamp>
<p>I mean, that's when
I first realized, you know,
</p><timestamp>00:13:03</timestamp>
<p>I'm a total screw-up.
</p><timestamp>00:13:05</timestamp>
<p>You're not a screw-up
anymore, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:13:07</timestamp>
<p>You're about to have
a hit rock opera on your hands.
</p><timestamp>00:13:09</timestamp>
<p>I'm really glad
you think that.
</p><timestamp>00:13:12</timestamp>
<p>I got Princess Carolyn
to invite
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>Virgil Van Cleef
to our next rehearsal.
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>Who in the what Van?
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>Virgil Van Cleef is
the biggest name in rock opera.
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>Okay, think of all
the great rock operas
from the last 20 years.
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>He had a piece of all of them.
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>Wow, Todd, are you sure
we're ready for that?
</p><timestamp>00:13:30</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you said yourself
the train is moving,
but if you think
we're not ready,
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I'll listen to you.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you've done
enough listening, buddy.
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>Maybe it's about time
I start listening.
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>Well, I feel like--
<subtitle>phone ringing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:40</timestamp>
<p>Gotta take this.
Hello?
</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>
<p>Hello?
BoJack Horseman?
</p><timestamp>00:13:44</timestamp>
<p>We have some very delicate
pictures you might
have an interest in not getting
into the wrong hands.
</p><timestamp>00:13:48</timestamp>
<p>I am very happy
with my current
long distance provider,
thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm having lunch with my friend.
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p><i>But if you just listen--</i>
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>All right, gang, when Virgil Van
Cleef gets here, look alive.
</p><timestamp>00:14:02</timestamp>
<p>This could be Todd's big break,
so clap really hard
and laugh at all the jokes,
even if they're not funny,
but also, be careful,
because a lot of things
you might think are jokes
are not jokes,
so, you know, look out.
</p><timestamp>00:14:13</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:15</timestamp>
<p>- That was not a joke.
- That was not a real laugh.
</p><timestamp>00:14:17</timestamp>
<p>I hope you don't mind
I brought Wayne along.
</p><timestamp>00:14:19</timestamp>
<p>- Who's Wayne?
- I'm Wayne.
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>I just wanted to make sure
he had everything he needs
for the big <i>BuzzFeed</i>
cover story.
</p><timestamp>00:14:25</timestamp>
<p><i>BuzzFeed</i> is a website.
There is no cover.

<p>Yep, to San Francisco.

<p>What you're about to see
is rough, very rough.
</p><timestamp>00:14:53</timestamp>
<p>It's a vomit pass at what
might become a rock opera.
</p><timestamp>00:14:56</timestamp>
<p>Right now, it's set
mostly in space,
but we're not married
to that.
</p><timestamp>00:14:59</timestamp>
<p>Todd is neither a singer
nor a trained musician.
</p><timestamp>00:15:01</timestamp>
<p>In fact, he never even
graduated high school,
he told me in confidence.
</p><timestamp>00:15:05</timestamp>
<p>Keep all that in mind
as you give it up for Todd.

Andrew Lloyd Webber has to be
a real hot penis
about everything.
</p><timestamp>00:15:51</timestamp>
<p>Oh, Andy.
Fool me once, shame on you,
but teach a man to fool me,

</p><timestamp>00:15:58</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, could this show
be ready to debut in six weeks?
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p>Six weeks? Uh, damn.
Yeah, I guess so.
</p><timestamp>00:16:04</timestamp>
<p>Marvelous! We'll schedule
an investor showcase posthaste.

you have a person pegged,
he can still find ways
to surprise you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, Todd really rose
to the occasion, didn't he?
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>I was talking about you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>Ah, well,
it was nothing.
</p><timestamp>00:16:24</timestamp>
<p>Maybe the Zoe has
a little Zelda in him after all.
</p><timestamp>00:16:27</timestamp>
<p>I appreciate the sentiment,
but I still think
that game is stupid.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>Hey, BoJack, do you realize
what this means?
</p><timestamp>00:16:32</timestamp>
<p>I mean, if this thing's a hit,
I could finally move out.
</p><timestamp>00:16:35</timestamp>
<p>Oh, uh,
you're gonna move out?
</p><timestamp>00:16:37</timestamp>
<p>You won't have to yell,
"Hey, Todd, clean up your shit!"
</p><timestamp>00:16:40</timestamp>
<p>Or, "Todd, why haven't you
cleaned up your shit yet?"
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>
<p>Or, "Todd, what was the name of
that guy from <i>Perfect Strangers?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:46</timestamp>
<p>Not Bronson Pinchot,
but the other one?"
</p><timestamp>00:16:48</timestamp>
<p>Good, that's great.
That's great and good.
</p><timestamp>00:16:51</timestamp>
<p>So good, so great.

<p>Todd's not ready
or you're not ready?
</p><timestamp>00:17:16</timestamp>
<p>Don't make this about me.
I've seen what happens
when baby birds get pushed
out of the nest too soon.
</p><timestamp>00:17:21</timestamp>
<p>It's not your fault.
</p><timestamp>00:17:24</timestamp>
<p>I thought he was ready.
He seemed ready.
</p><timestamp>00:17:26</timestamp>
<p>It's not... your... fault.
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>You're right.
In these heady times,
what Todd needs is an agent.
Ha! Ha!
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>- I just need you to deliver...
- Hoo! Ha!
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>- That third act showstopper...
- Ha!
</p><timestamp>00:17:39</timestamp>
<p>...and then we'll be
fully financed!
</p><timestamp>00:17:41</timestamp>
<p>Todd can do it!
Todd can do anything!
</p><timestamp>00:17:44</timestamp>
<p>- Can I get your autograph?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:17:45</timestamp>
<p>And another autograph,
and initial here, here,
here, and here.
</p><timestamp>00:17:48</timestamp>
<p>- Right here?
- And the last four digits
</p><timestamp>00:17:50</timestamp>
<p>- of your social.
- Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>So I think the big
third act number Virgil wants
might be a big anthem that--
</p><timestamp>00:17:56</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa,
buddy, buddy,
</p><timestamp>00:17:58</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna let you start
on this until we stock up
on snacks and Red Bull.
</p><timestamp>00:18:02</timestamp>
<p>I do get snacky.
You think of everything.
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>'Scuse me, young man.
</p><timestamp>00:18:10</timestamp>
<p>Can you hand me
that Ronnie Milsap cassingle
in the 10-cent bin?
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>Sure thing, lady.
</p><timestamp>00:18:17</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God.
Decapathon VII?
</p><timestamp>00:18:21</timestamp>
<p>This just came out.
</p><timestamp>00:18:23</timestamp>
<p>Todd, put it down.
</p><timestamp>00:18:24</timestamp>
<p>Is this really
only a dime?
</p><timestamp>00:18:26</timestamp>
<p>If it's in there,
that's the price.
</p><timestamp>00:18:28</timestamp>
<p>Todd, this is no time
for a relapse.
</p><timestamp>00:18:31</timestamp>
<p>Look, okay, I'll buy it now,
but I won't play it
till after I've written
the new song.
</p><timestamp>00:18:35</timestamp>
<p>Todd, this is a bad idea!
</p><timestamp>00:18:38</timestamp>
<p>- Whoa!
- All sales are final.
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>Okay, let's see here.
</p><timestamp>00:18:45</timestamp>
<p>I wonder if it still
smells the same.
</p><timestamp>00:18:47</timestamp>
<p>I assure you,
it still smells

<p>We both know that if you
play that game tonight,
you'll never leave
this couch!

<p>I apologize for wasting your

</p><timestamp>00:20:29</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Van Cleef,
Todd may not be ready
for the high-flying world
of rock opera
or the larger world
outside of my living room couch,
but you know what?
He's a good friend.
</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>I don't see
how that's relevant.
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>No, of course you don't.
Maybe Todd's worse off today,
but you're worse off
in the long run,
because you're gonna die
alone and unloved,
you pompous,
affected asshole!

</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>Shut your mouth, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>And you shut yours, Van Cleef,

<p>I was more than

<p>Fool me once, fool me twice,

they don't call it

</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>Hey, no.
Hold on to that.
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you just put it
in the living room closet?
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p>- Really?
- In fact, from now on,
you can keep all your stuff
in the living room closet.
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>Thanks, BoJack,
for everything.
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>This, I will get rid of.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>- What the--
- Don't look at those!
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>- Those are private!
- Are these the notes
you've been taking
on Mr. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>It's gibberish!
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>Have you just been mashing keys
this whole time?
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>It's a-- it's a work
in progress.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>What's really going on here?
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>Look, I've been following
you two around
for the last couple weeks,
and I think it's pretty obvious
to everyone that you shouldn't
be with Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>You should be with me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>No, I've dated you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>Sure, you're smart
and sophisticated and cool,
but you're also mean.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>What's your article
on Mr. Peanutbutter called?
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>The working title is,

</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>- I knew it!
- Come on!
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>Like you're not gonna
tear BoJack apart in your book.
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>I'm not "tearing him apart."
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>I'm writing a nuanced portrait
of a complicated man.
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>Well, then, we might be
doing different things.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter
is nice to me!
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>He's kind and he's generous
and he's loyal.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>You know what your problem is?
You're trying to be a Zelda
but you're so obviously a Zoe.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>Ugh! Don't label me.
You don't know who I am.
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p>You can live your happy Zelda
life in this happy Zelda town
and pretend you're
a happy Zelda,
but I know you,
and this isn't you.
