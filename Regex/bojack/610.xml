<p>Why does everything
have to be "Chicago-style" here?
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>We get it. We're in Chicago.

</p><timestamp>00:01:36</timestamp>
<p>Wanna go try and hit
a Chicago-style museum?
</p><timestamp>00:01:39</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I'd love to, but I really have
to work on my book. Next time.

I've officially been a good boyfriend.

<p>Hello. I am Diane,
and I am a young girl living in Boston
and ever since I was that,
</p><timestamp>00:03:01</timestamp>
<p>I wanted to write good things
that were good,
this is not good, fix this later.
</p><timestamp>00:03:05</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunting</subtitle> Diane, as your father,
I am very unsupportive.
</p><timestamp>00:03:09</timestamp>
<p>Come up with examples
of Dad being unsupportive.
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>Okay, yes.
And, also, the girls from high school.
</p><timestamp>00:03:16</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I'm Krissy Keating.
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Can you use my real name?
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Check if it's okay to use my real name.
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, I was a real bitch to you,
but now maybe you're realizing
I was bullied, too?
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Is any of this interesting?
-<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle><i> Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>Put me in your book.
Remember I gave you that salad bowl?
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And I broke the bowl!
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>Answer your phone.
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>And I glued it back together with gold
because I read an article
about the Japanese art of kintsugi!
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-And it fell apart again.
-It kept falling apart like our marriage!
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Mr. Peanutbutter</subtitle> Is that something?
Is any of this anything?
</p><timestamp>00:03:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> <i>Diane. Answer your phone.</i>

<p>{\an8}-Hello?
-<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle><i> Hey, Diane.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>If I had my shitty students
do a night of scenes here
at the end of the semester,
would you come see it?
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>It's gonna suck, so I wanna pack the house
with friendly faces.
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>When you sell it like that,
how can I resist?
</p><timestamp>00:04:06</timestamp>
<p><i>How's that book coming?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>-I'm actually at the mall, writing it now.
-Why are you writing at the mall?
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I couldn't focus at home
and this is the only place
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I could sit and work for ten hours.
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I can get lunch here, I can people-watch,
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}all without having to endure
what the Chicagoans refer to as "spring."
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hey, Chicago, 49 degrees is not spring.
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-It's the non-Lachey half of a boy band.
<i>-What?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Forty-nine! Half of 98?
</p><timestamp>00:04:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Diane, don't workshop your material
in casual conversation.
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Howie Mandel used to do it, too.
Like, really, Howie?
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You just happened to have a rubber glove
in your pocket?
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>All I need to do now
is actually write my book.
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>I have so many stories to tell,
but I can't seem to figure out
what the book is.
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>You gonna put any stories
about me in there?
</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I think I've written about you enough.
<i>-But no one else is as good at it!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm sure someone will rise
to the occasion.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>Baxter, darling, I've just a moment
to update you on the progress
of our Penny Carson crusade.
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So far, we've been able to contact three
of the four Penny Carsons
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}listed in New Mexico.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Baxter, there's nowhere I'd rather be
than on our honeymoon cruise to "Unjuga,"
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}but I simply can't stop now.
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>We're on the lookout for the fourth Penny,
and, God willing, she'll be the lucky one.
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p>Oh! Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>-Caw-caw! Caw-caw!
-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>Oh... <subtitle>stammers</subtitle>
Sorry, I didn't mean you. Paige!
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>Kisses, Baxter dear,
it appears we've found our deer.
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Book, here we go.
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>I grow up in Boston town
because my father,
who I never was close with,
live in Boston.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>That's not right English,
I'll fix it later.
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>Me from Boston.
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>Well, you're not from Boston, but yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>-Whatever for now.
-Beantown.
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>To really understand
what it's like to grow up in Boston,
you actually have to go back 250 years
to the Boston Tea Party.
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>Taxation without representation
is wicked unjust, bro!
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>Bro, check it out.
I'm teabaggin' the harbor.
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no freakin' way.

<p>-<subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>-Go, Pats. Unrelated.
-<subtitle>Diane</subtitle> Stop.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>-I'm getting distracted.
-Why can't you stay focused?
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>What's wrong with your head, Deedee?
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The idea behind
the Japanese art of kintsugi
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}is that cracks in an object
are part of its history.
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What does that have to do with anything?
-We have to look at trauma!
</p><timestamp>00:06:15</timestamp>
<p>Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:06:16</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>woman</subtitle> We totally have to look at Trauma.
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-There's a spring sale.
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>Forty percent off.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Ivy</subtitle> Did you hear
security still can't figure out
who's stealing wallets? Like... <subtitle>scoffs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>I bet my life it's that hag Devon
from the hair crimper cart.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, yes,
that theory is beast, Ivy.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>-Excuse me, I'm sorry...
-We forgive you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>You know the story about Gemberly, right?
What they found in her locker?
</p><timestamp>00:06:43</timestamp>
<p>-Tell me.
-It was a--
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>I meant "Pardon me, I need another size."
</p><timestamp>00:06:47</timestamp>
<p>But I can't seem to find
a number on the tag?
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>-We don't see size here at Trauma.
-Okay, but can you help me?
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p>Sure. I think it would help
if you figured out
why you need to put a number on your body,
and let me get back to this mystery.
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>Thanks.

-Hello?
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Ivy</subtitle> Oh, my God,
she's like taking a phone call.
</p><timestamp>00:07:07</timestamp>
<p>Diane! Great news!
</p><timestamp>00:07:09</timestamp>
<p>"Birthday Dad" premiered last night
to a 0.006,
which is the biggest network hit
since the inventor
of blood-scented perfume
went on <i>Shark Tank</i>
and got her arm bitten off.
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>Great!
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p>Meanwhile, my company's running
like gangbusters.
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>Is gangbusters a slur of some sort?
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>-Can we still say gangbusters?
-I'll look into it.
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>And with Todd watching the baby,
my work-life balance is on point.
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>-Did you call me just to brag?
<i>-I was thinking...</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>What would make my work-life balance
even on pointier?
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p>And it hit me: more work!
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>So, I thought I'd check in
and see how your book's doing.
</p><timestamp>00:07:39</timestamp>
<p>Oh. I'm still kind of figuring out
what the "is" of it is, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>-It's been six months.
-Okay, I think it's about...
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>-Trauma.
<i>-Trauma?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>Or... damage.
</p><timestamp>00:07:51</timestamp>
<p>You know, those bowls that break
and then the cracks get filled with gold
and then they're even more beautiful?
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>Maybe it's like that, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:07:57</timestamp>
<p>Like, we've all been damaged,
but it's good damage
because it makes us more who we are.
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p>Is that anything?
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, good damage. I like it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:05</timestamp>
<p>Send me the pages
and we'll get 'em to the publisher.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>Okay, but no hurry?
</p><timestamp>00:08:08</timestamp>
<p>Okay, but, no. Hurry.
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>What can I get ya?
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>Some information
with a side order of revelation.
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>Is that a type of pasta?
</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>Oh, also a water. I am parched.
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>In fact, why don't you freeze
that water into a cube shape
and drop it in some bourbon.
</p><timestamp>00:08:25</timestamp>
<p>We're looking to identify
an associate of Sarah Lynn's.
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>Sarah Lynn? Is this about BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>Is it about BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p>I don't know what you're looking for,
but I don't know anything about it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:35</timestamp>
<p>Okay? I haven't seen BoJack in years.
Or Sarah Lynn.
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>But you have seen them?
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna go ask the kitchen
about your pasta.
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>Wait, that's the fellow
from the police report,
who found the dead girl
in the planetarium.
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>-Yes?
-<i>Found</i> the dead girl.
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>-Are you smelling what I'm smelling?
-<subtitle>snorts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:52</timestamp>
<p>If he was also with her
at the AA meeting...
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>Well, then why wouldn't he mention it
to the police? What's he hiding?
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>You're starting to make more sense
than a change machine.
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, speaking of cents,
what happened to Penny?
</p><timestamp>00:09:02</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, poop! Our scoop's flown the coop!
-Go, go, go! Gotta stay in the loop!
</p><timestamp>00:09:11</timestamp>
<p>"So in a way, that salad bowl was me,
and the cracks... were also me..."
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>-Ugh! It sucks, I'm sorry.
-It's a first draft.
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>I can't remember what happened when
and I keep getting distracted.
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>It's because of the meds.
This is what I was afraid would happen.
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>But isn't it worth it?
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>You've been feeling
so much better, right?
</p><timestamp>00:09:27</timestamp>
<p>I do feel lighter, and clearer,
but also so foggy.
</p><timestamp>00:09:31</timestamp>
<p>You feel clear and foggy?
How is that even possible?
</p><timestamp>00:09:34</timestamp>
<p>-I don't know! Because of the fog.
-Hey. Stick with it.
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>-With the writing? Or the fog?
-Both.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Okay. So, start at the beginning.
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm a baby.
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Hey, baby!
</p><timestamp>00:09:48</timestamp>
<p>Isn't it great to grow up in a comfortable
upper-middle class home,
surrounded by love?
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But I didn't grow up surrounded by love.
That's the problem.
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>You were fine!
Name one example of me being a bad dad.
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>Uh, okay! What about how you made me lose
on purpose at Boggle
</p><timestamp>00:10:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so my brothers would think they were,
quote, "wicked smarter than a girl."
</p><timestamp>00:10:09</timestamp>
<p>-That's all you got?
-I got other things!
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>There was lots of shit. Constantly!
I just can't express--
</p><timestamp>00:10:15</timestamp>
<p>Is this what your book is?
Just you complaining?
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>As your target audience,
I'm not hooked yet.
</p><timestamp>00:10:22</timestamp>
<p>You are not my target audience.
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Ivy</subtitle> This book is like bore me
with a spoon, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:10:26</timestamp>
<p>You know the story about Gemberly, right?
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>
<p>-What they found in her locker?
-Tell me.
</p><timestamp>00:10:29</timestamp>
<p>It was a note from the thief,
saying where all the wallets were hidden.
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>
<p>What? What is this? I'm trying to write
about my childhood trauma.
</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>-Who are you?
-I'm Ivy.
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>My mom and I just moved to Chicago
from Southern California.
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> <i>What? No. I can't...</i>
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>My dad died and we needed a new start.
</p><timestamp>00:10:43</timestamp>
<p>I don't really get Chicago yet,
and the winters are cold AF,
so I hang out at the mall a lot.
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>Malls are fun!
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>Or "beast," which is slang
that young people like me say.
</p><timestamp>00:10:53</timestamp>
<p>-You're Ivy Tran, right?
-Ivy T. That's me!
</p><timestamp>00:10:56</timestamp>
<p>I-I need help.
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>Someone's been filching onesies
by the twosies
from the fourth floor Baby Hole,
and if I don't figure out whodunnit,

</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
-We have to talk.
</p><timestamp>00:20:48</timestamp>
<p>Shh. Diane!
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>-Don't be rude to the actors.

<p>For most of them,
this'll be the height of their career.
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Anyway, first up is a scene
from Sam German-Shepard's "Real America."

<p><subtitle>Kyle laughing</subtitle>
Char, hey, you gotta get in here!
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>This episode of "Birthday Dad"
is an all-timer!
</p><timestamp>00:21:09</timestamp>
<p>-Penny...
-I wanted to get something.
</p><timestamp>00:21:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> I don't feel good about
what happened with those reporters.
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>-It's okay.
-We didn't tell them... everything.
</p><timestamp>00:21:27</timestamp>
<p>I tried to throw it out, but I couldn't.
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>I know that's messed up,
but I think I look nice here.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh! You look beautiful.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>I don't think that's the only reason
I kept the photo, Mom.
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>It's all really confusing.
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Kyle</subtitle> Charlotte! Birthday Dad
just got trapped in a leap year!
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>-How's he gonna wriggle outta this one?
-In a minute, honey!
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>Stuff happened to us, okay?
And he's still out there.
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>-Penny--
-If we can get the word out,
</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p>-if-if people knew--
-It won't be just him in the story.
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>It'll be you and me. The mistakes we made.
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>Mistakes I made,
that I will never forgive myself for.
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>But if we can help other people,
then it will have been for something,
you know?
</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p>It won't just be this thing
to feel bad about forever.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>You don't know what's gonna happen
with the story once it's out there.
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>You have no power over it.
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>And you just got your panic attacks
under control.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I know, but--
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>I love that you want to do what's right,
but please just think about it, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>Just give it a couple days
and then if you still want to talk
to them, you can call them.
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>You wanna stay and watch "Birthday Dad"?
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>-Stay the night?
-No, I-I should go.
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Yeah. I love you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>I love you, too.
</p><timestamp>00:22:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Kyle</subtitle> Oh! Is that the International
Date Line?
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p>Don't go over the date line, Birthday Dad!
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
<p>Because then it won't be your birthday
anymore! <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>cheering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>Thank you. Thank you so much.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>Come on, Todd, let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>But I wanna see
if there's an after-credits scene.
</p><timestamp>00:23:07</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Princess Carolyn</subtitle> Talk soon, Diane.
-Hey, wait a minute.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>door opens, closes</subtitle>
-Princess Carolyn. <subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn, wait.
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>I understand you're trying to be helpful,
</p><timestamp>00:23:17</timestamp>
<p>-in your own pushy, self-absorbed way.
-Oh, thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>But I don't wanna write
a middle-grade fiction detective series.
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>I think you do, though.
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>Because when I was reading it,
I could tell you were having fun.
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but I'm not writing a book
to have fun.
</p><timestamp>00:23:30</timestamp>
<p>If I don't write my book of essays now,
I never will!
</p><timestamp>00:23:33</timestamp>
<p>So? Don't write your book of essays.
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>-I have to!
-Why?
</p><timestamp>00:23:36</timestamp>
<p>Because if I don't,
that means that all the damage I got
isn't good damage, it's just damage.
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p>I have gotten nothing out of it,
and all those years
I was miserable was for nothing.
</p><timestamp>00:23:48</timestamp>
<p>I could have been happy this whole time
and written books about girl detectives
and been cheerful and popular
and had good parents,
is that what you're saying?
What was it all for?
</p><timestamp>00:23:57</timestamp>
<p>I...
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>I don't know, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:24:01</timestamp>
<p>All I know is that this book
about the girl detective is fun.
</p><timestamp>00:24:06</timestamp>
<p>I liked it.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>I like thinking that my daughter
could grow up in a world
with books like that.
</p><timestamp>00:24:11</timestamp>
<p>Or if my daughter's not a reader,
a lucrative film adaptation.
</p><timestamp>00:24:14</timestamp>
<p>When I was a little girl,
I thought that everything,
all the abuse and neglect,
it somehow made me special,
and I decided that one day
I would write something
that would make little girls like me
feel less alone.
</p><timestamp>00:24:27</timestamp>
<p>And if I can't write that book...
</p><timestamp>00:24:30</timestamp>
<p>Then...
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>Then maybe write this other book.
</p><timestamp>00:24:35</timestamp>
<p>-Maybe this book does that, too.
-Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:24:42</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Ruthie giggles</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:24:45</timestamp>
<p>-Uh... Princess Carolyn?
-What reporters?
</p><timestamp>00:24:48</timestamp>
<p>BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:24:49</timestamp>
<p>Charlotte, I swear,
I don't know what you're talking about.
