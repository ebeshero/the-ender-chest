<p>Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.
</p><timestamp>00:00:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Nixon</subtitle> I can do whatever I want.
</p><timestamp>00:00:14</timestamp>
<p>I'm president of the goddamn
United States of America.
</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p>Isn't that right, Checkers?
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>That's what it says
on your business cards.
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>There are going to be riots
in the streets.
</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>I'm Secretariat.
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>You think I'm afraid
of a few rioting hippies?
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>Or whatever a laugh sounds like.
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>Please, I'll do anything.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>You gotta send someone else
in my place.
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be...
arranged.
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero.</i>
<i>My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.</i>

</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Groovy.

</p><timestamp>00:01:10</timestamp>
<p>What the hell are you doing?
</p><timestamp>00:01:12</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, Mommy!
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p>Don't you dare put that out.
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>That is a perfectly good cigarette,
and you are going to finish it.
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>But I don't wanna.
</p><timestamp>00:01:20</timestamp>
<p>And I don't want to be
the mother of a quitter.
</p><timestamp>00:01:22</timestamp>
<p>Finish it.
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>coughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p>Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke
a cigarette right.
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>Don't you dare cry,
don't you ever cry.
</p><timestamp>00:01:31</timestamp>
<p>You wanted this.
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>Are you punishing me for smoking
or for stealing?
</p><timestamp>00:01:36</timestamp>
<p>I'm punishing you for being alive.
</p><timestamp>00:01:43</timestamp>
<p>Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:01:45</timestamp>
<p>Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw
a lit cigarette off the--
</p><timestamp>00:01:48</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>fire roaring</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:49</timestamp>
<p>Fine. I'll call 911.
</p><timestamp>00:01:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>♪♪</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The fire department got
everything under control,
</p><timestamp>00:02:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}but the cable's out
for the neighborhood.
</p><timestamp>00:02:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I don't understand
what started the fire.
</p><timestamp>00:02:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Nobody knows where fires come from,
it's a mystery.
</p><timestamp>00:02:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Anyway, I am fired up
about my first day back on set.
</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We're gonna finish
that big Nixon scene.
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We were just one shot away
before we went on hiatus.
</p><timestamp>00:03:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yeah, I know.
You told me at breakfast.
</p><timestamp>00:03:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Why did you call me?
</p><timestamp>00:03:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Usually I talk to Diane
on the way to work,
</p><timestamp>00:03:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}but she abandoned me to teach piano
in Cordovia or something.
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Well, glad you settled for me
because Diane wasn't available.
</p><timestamp>00:03:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill
in this Nixon scene.
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}BoJack gonna be in "da" house.
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}In da White House.
</p><timestamp>00:03:24</timestamp>
<p>What happened to da house set?
Da White House set?
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Things changed a little.
-You cut the Nixon scene?
</p><timestamp>00:03:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The Nixon scene is the core
of the whole movie.
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>Where we see Secretariat
be morally corrupted
and get to look
into the real darkness of his soul.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>It's still all that,
except now it happens
while you give a Christmas present
to your nieces
and they hug you
while your butt is stuck in a chimney.
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>Is one of the nieces Nixon?
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}People don't want
all that controversial stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>But we were supposed to make
a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Warts and all.
-Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's why they took the gay stuff
out of <i>A Beautiful Mind.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:58</timestamp>
<p>Know that guy who spent 12 years
as a slave?
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>They don't talk about the 60 years
he spent as a jerk.
</p><timestamp>00:04:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Kelsey, you're okay with this?
-Eh...
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's showbiz.
</p><timestamp>00:04:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}See, BoJack,
that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Good shrugging, kid.
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yo! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the...
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's the end of your name.
We need to talk.
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We'll meet in the supply closet
in one minute. Break!
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p>Oh, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, ow.
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>Carolyn, when you're in the throes
of a very ugly divorce such as I am,
along with all that pain and degradation
comes a certain perfect clarity,
and right now that clarity is telling me
that you and I should get out of here.
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>Well, what do you mean,
"get out of here"?
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,
and I want you to be my partner in crime.
</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>What? But I can't just leave Vigor.
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>I've been here 20 years.
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>Who's gonna water the plants?
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?
</p><timestamp>00:04:50</timestamp>
<p>I started doing it as an intern,
but then no one told me to stop,
so it's still kind of my job.
</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>Carolyn,
you are my gritty, witty city kitty.
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>I want you with me, fifty-fifty.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>Things are so crazy
for me right now. I--
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>Don't give me that, you want crazy.
"Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline song
and your second favorite
Gnarls Barkley song.
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>I don't want crazy.
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>I've got five episodes
of <i>The Good Wife </i>piled up on my DVR,
and I just want a night off
to enjoy them.
</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p>Well, if that's how you feel, I guess
I could just go to Vanessa Gekko.
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Carolyn</subtitle> Gekko?!
-But I'd rather look at you all day.
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>You're an amazing agent.
And you're bright, and you're fun.
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>And I think we could make something
really special.
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>We weren't doing anything!
We were just looking for closet supplies.
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>Are you the person to talk to
about unclogging the toilet?
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>Stuart, I'm your boss.
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>Okay, but you're the one
in the janitor's closet, so...
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p>-What, I'm the idiot?
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> <i>The first thing you notice</i>
<i>about Sebastian St. Clair</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p><i>is that he speaks in paragraphs.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:51</timestamp>
<p>Even I can't believe
how much good we've done here,
and I'll believe almost anything.
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>In the last six weeks,
we dug a new well, built a school,
and next month
the community center is doing <i>Seussical.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>There we go.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> <i>In his previous life,</i>
<i>Sebastian owned</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p><i>a chain of high-end department stores.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>I want to stock up on muffs.
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>We're going to sell a lot of muffs
this winter. Huzzah!
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>Diane, I lived a life
of power and luxury,
and then my picture
was in the newspaper.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>-A real-life newspaper!
-Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>But I knew my life was empty.
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p><i>At night I heard the cries</i>
<i>of children sick and dying.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p><i>And I would scream into the night.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>Shut up! Shut up, children!
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p><i>But the phantom cries would not abate.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>And so I began my travels,
with little more than a compass,
a yearning for adventure,
and several crates full of unsold muffs.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>I knew there were people out there
just waiting for my help.
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>Diane, this is Kinko.
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>
<p>I am Kinko.
</p><timestamp>00:06:43</timestamp>
<p>In his language, it means,
orphan whose parents were murdered
by rebels and will die young,
probably from malaria.
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>Hi, Kinko. I'm Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>It means,
my parents liked the show <i>Cheers.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p><i>Cheers! </i>Oh, you're good.
You're very good.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> <i>When Sebastian St. Clair says</i>
<i>you're good,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:00</timestamp>
<p><i>you want to believe</i>
<i>that you really are.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p><i>That you, like Sebastian, are part</i>
<i>of something bigger than just yourself.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p><i>And for a moment,</i>
<i>you feel like you are.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:09</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Sebastian</subtitle> Oh, Kinko made a mess.
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>Now I finally realize that a triple hug is
way more valuable than a Triple Crown.
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>And cut. Neat.
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p>-Let's break for lunch.
-<subtitle>kids</subtitle> Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>Kelsey, this is a nightmare.
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>I had to touch three children today,
and one of them was sticky.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, it was you.
Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack, there's nothing we can do.
-No, this isn't you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>I've seen everything you've done.
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p>Your films are challenging and gritty,
and they're great.
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>I'm not just saying that
because they're full of lesbians.
</p><timestamp>00:07:40</timestamp>
<p>Look, even if I wanted to finish
that Nixon scene,
we don't have an Oval Office set.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>There's one at the Nixon Library
in Yorba Linda.
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>Why on earth do you know that?
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>In season three of <i>Horsin' Around,</i>
the horse got elected president
and we shot on location.
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>We can sneak into the library
and get the shot, guerilla-style.
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>Once Turteltaub sees it,
he'll love it,
and we can make the movie
we both want to make.
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:00</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.
-All right!
</p><timestamp>00:08:03</timestamp>
<p>Did they really make
your character president?
</p><timestamp>00:08:06</timestamp>
<p>Only for season three.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>In season four, it turned out
it was all a dream.
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>They called my airplane <i>Air Horse One.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>And the vice president was
a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>-Come on.
-It wasn't our best season.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>But on the bright side,
was not our worst.
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p><i>Step one, we go to the Nixon Library...</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:22</timestamp>
<p><i>and steal the scale model.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man as Nixon</subtitle> Welcome to my library.
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>I'm Nixon. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>.
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>in normal voice</subtitle> Yeah, you know,
some people say I look like Nixon.
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p>Not because he's my dad or anything.
That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.
</p><timestamp>00:08:36</timestamp>
<p>But if you have any questions about Nixon,
I'd be happy to answer them.
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I have a question. Um...
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>Is that the lighted exit sign
from Nixon's boyhood home?
</p><timestamp>00:08:46</timestamp>
<p>Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>-Is that...
-Here we go.
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>...the handicapped drinking fountain
he used in the White House?
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>No, just a normal drinking fountain.
</p><timestamp>00:08:55</timestamp>
<p>-Hang on.
-One more.
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>-Is that the smoke alarm--?
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles nervously</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So the Oval Office is right here,
next to the men's room.
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I remember because season three
of<i> Horsin' Around </i>was a big cocaine year.
</p><timestamp>00:09:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}All the pressures of being president.
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>-I don't see how we'll pull this off.
-We're gonna need a crack team.
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>First, we gotta get
the best lock-pick in the city.
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>-Not interested.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:09:19</timestamp>
<p><i>The second best lock-pick in the city.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:09:21</timestamp>
<p>-No way I'm doing that.
-Got it.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p><i>A lock-pick.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>Todd, can you pick locks?
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>-Kind of.
-Great. You're in.
</p><timestamp>00:09:27</timestamp>
<p><i>We'll need an expert cat burglar.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>All right, <i>Good Wife,</i>
let's see what you got.
</p><timestamp>00:09:31</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Hey, Princess Carolyn!
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>Kelsey and I are gonna break
into the Nixon library
to steal a shot
for our Secretariat movie.
</p><timestamp>00:09:38</timestamp>
<p>It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper
that stands to benefit you in no way.
</p><timestamp>00:09:43</timestamp>
<p>Are you in?
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man</subtitle> Hey! Shut up down there!
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> You shut up!

</p><timestamp>00:09:48</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Hey, you got a problem?

<p>Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.
</p><timestamp>00:09:59</timestamp>
<p>What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Da Bears.
</p><timestamp>00:10:02</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I'd love to help you out,
but I'm super-busy recording promos
for television's
highest-rated new game show.
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>-We can probably do it without you.
-This next one's for Seattle.
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Rain.
</p><timestamp>00:10:18</timestamp>
<p>It's too bad though because I could
really bring a lot to this project.
</p><timestamp>00:10:21</timestamp>
<p>The more I think about it,
Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>It's just a single on Secretariat.
</p><timestamp>00:10:26</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.
What does Ethan Hawke know?
</p><timestamp>00:10:30</timestamp>
<p>-We'll find out tonight. So sorry.
-You know what? Forget I even asked.
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>

-Now, we need to lose the cops.
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>The rest of you will create a diversion
by breaking into the only other place
in Yorba Linda of cultural significance:
the Discount Fine Art Gallery

</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>

-You're right. I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>There you are!
I've been trying to call you all week.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, the coverage in Cordovia is--
<i>-Diane, Diane.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>Listen, I gotta tell you:
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry I gave you such
a hard time about your trip.
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>The truth is,
I really am so proud of you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p><i>A lot of people talk big,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p><i>but you're actually out there</i>

</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p><i>You're the real deal, Diane.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah...
-How is it there? Is it amazing?
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>It's... good.
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>It's hard, but it's good.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>I miss you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>I miss you, too, but I promise,
these six months are gonna fly by.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. How's the game show going?
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed
to be hosting a game show right now.

</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>I know what you're gonna say.
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm a dumb sitcom actor
who's in over his head.
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.
</p><timestamp>00:22:41</timestamp>
<p>And I'm sorry I made you come here.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry for everything.
I don't know what I'm doing.

<p>BoJack, sit down.

<p>You've just been told your brother is dead
and that it's your fault.
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>But this moment is bigger than that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
<p>This is the moment
that Secretariat stops running.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>Because this is the moment you realize
something inside you is broken,
and it can never be fixed.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>We got it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p>Really? I didn't cry.
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>You didn't have to.
Turteltaub's gonna love this.
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>-Oh. All right.
-Thanks for talking me into this.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>Just so you know, I'm really glad
we're making this movie together.
</p><timestamp>00:23:23</timestamp>
<p>-Didn't know I had it in me, did you?
-No, I knew.
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>crying</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:46</timestamp>
<p>-Hold the elevator, please.
-Coming in?
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>-I'm all in.
-Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:23:55</timestamp>
<p>Mommy, it's nearly Christmas.
Where's Uncle Secretariat?
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>He had to go win a race
against the Russians.
</p><timestamp>00:24:01</timestamp>
<p>But maybe, if he runs really fast...
</p><timestamp>00:24:04</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, where's Kelsey?
-Oh, yeah, funny story.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>Turns out you two knuckleheads
snuck out last night
and got that shot
I told you not to get for the scene
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>-that's not in the movie anymore.
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:24:14</timestamp>
<p>Silly me, I didn't like that.
So I fired her ass.
</p><timestamp>00:24:16</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-We got a movie to finish, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>
<p>So, go get in costume,
get your butt up that chimney,
and do your thing, Hamlet.
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p>Just maybe,
all we have to do is believe!
