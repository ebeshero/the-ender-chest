<p>Someone find out the average rainfall
in Bora Bora.
</p><timestamp>00:00:14</timestamp>
<p>Thank you so much for doing this.
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>Hey, there are a lot of advantages to
being the girlfriend of a big celebrity.
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>It's more than being an elbow
they couldn't crop out of
a red-carpet shot in <i>US Weekly.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>-I've been that elbow.
-Hello, what have we here?
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>So you know
how the game's played, right?
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure I'll pick it up.
How hard could it be?
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>You didn't read the treatment?
I faxed it to you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>My bad, our fax machine
isn't plugged in.
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, this is our first show
and it is very important that things
run smoothly tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>I mean, do you even care
about this at all?
</p><timestamp>00:00:41</timestamp>
<p>Sweetie, no. I think this is stupid
and a waste of everybody's time.
</p><timestamp>00:00:45</timestamp>
<p>But you're my girlfriend
and I care about you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>-So I'm here.
-Okay. Break a leg.
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>vocalizing</subtitle> Me, me, me. My, my, my.
Bow-wow-wow-wow.
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>Good boy, good boy.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>Okay, this is it, everybody.
Moment of truth.
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>Now it's in the hands of god.
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>And for the next 30 minutes,
I am that God.
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>-I got you an iPad, ma'am.
-Oh, no thanks, Mia.
</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm still working my way through
the last 30 years of technology.
</p><timestamp>00:01:09</timestamp>
<p>Right now I'm on Palm Pilot.
</p><timestamp>00:01:10</timestamp>
<p>But you can use our second screen app
to see what viewers say
about the show as it airs.
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>Oh, cool,
I love stupid bullshit like this. Ooh.
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you just touch it.
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p>Hello, I am Mustache Todd.
Like regular Todd, but with a mustache.
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>Listen boo-boo, I didn't graduate first in
my class from a prestigious university,
rise through the ranks at
an elite news organization,
win a well-known award,
never ever be sick at sea
and also my name is Mia McKibben,
so that I could deal with your nonsense.
</p><timestamp>00:01:38</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
-Todd, stay out of Hair and Makeup.
</p><timestamp>00:01:40</timestamp>
<p>But I like it there.
</p><timestamp>00:01:41</timestamp>
<p>They brush my hair and tell me stories
about their weekends.
</p><timestamp>00:01:44</timestamp>
<p>Big-nosed Todd wasn't funny,
Zombie Todd wasn't funny,
</p><timestamp>00:01:47</timestamp>
<p>Pretty Lady Todd wasn't funny,
and this isn't funny.
No more tomfoolery.
</p><timestamp>00:01:51</timestamp>
<p>When it's me,
we call it "Todd-foolery."
</p><timestamp>00:01:54</timestamp>
<p>We certainly do not call it that.
</p><timestamp>00:01:56</timestamp>
<p>Listen up, everyone.
</p><timestamp>00:01:57</timestamp>
<p>What you are part of tonight
is bigger than you.
</p><timestamp>00:01:59</timestamp>
<p>It's bigger than any of us.
</p><timestamp>00:02:01</timestamp>
<p>I expect all of you to work together.
</p><timestamp>00:02:03</timestamp>
<p>But I also expect that one of you
will tower above the rest.
</p><timestamp>00:02:06</timestamp>
<p>And that outstanding individual
will receive this pen.
</p><timestamp>00:02:11</timestamp>
<p>It was through this pen that I bled
</p><timestamp>00:02:14</timestamp>
<p><i>Raise High The Roof Beam,</i>
<i>Carpenters </i>upon the page.
</p><timestamp>00:02:17</timestamp>
<p>Also, it has four different colors.
</p><timestamp>00:02:19</timestamp>
<p>Black, red, blue
and for some reason, green.
</p><timestamp>00:02:22</timestamp>
<p>By the end of tonight,
this pen will be bestowed upon
the person most deserving.
</p><timestamp>00:02:27</timestamp>
<p>Because nothing is more
important than television,
and no one more important than
the people who make that television.

<p>{\an8}BoJack, what is the average

<p>-Uh, this is general knowledge?
-It's just an average we're asking for.
</p><timestamp>00:05:24</timestamp>
<p>-I don't know, seven?
-Wrong! So wrong.
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Wow, when it comes to Bora Bora,
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}maybe this celebrity should
have studied more-a more-a.
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>J.D.</subtitle>
Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter. Go for the kill.
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>

it's time to pick your category.

<p>"Trigonometry." "Advanced Physics,"
and "At the Movies With Mr. Peanutbutter."
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>At the Movies With
Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>Good choice. After seeing J.J. Abrams'
<i>Star Trek </i>reboot, did I call it:
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A, "A visual feast for the senses,"
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}B, "A zestful lark through time

<p>{\an8}C, "The best Zachary Quinto movie
of all time,"
</p><timestamp>00:06:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}or D, "All of the above"?
</p><timestamp>00:06:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I'll say D?
-Ouch, the answer was A and B.
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p><i>Though I would</i>
<i>also agree with C.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>So I told Mr. Peanutbutter
I'd drive him here,
and next thing I know,
I'm an Associate Producer.
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>Stupid me. I went to Stanford.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>Next time I'll just try that
thing where I'm a huge dumbass
who happens to be friends
with Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:06:26</timestamp>
<p>-Yup.
-Cool.
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>Well, have fun watching me
win that pen.
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>I don't need a pen.
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p>I can walk into any Chili's with a child
under 12 and get crayons for free.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>You don't get it.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>If Salinger gives you his pen,
that means you're worth something.
</p><timestamp>00:06:39</timestamp>
<p>It means you're a serious person
who's going places.
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>
<p>Actually, you know what?
Don't worry about it. It's not for you.

<p>You know, like King Tut?
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>Because we're talking about Egypt?

it's a positive bomb.

<p>Hey, you, you're doing great.
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>I'm not 100 percent watching
because I'm so engrossed
in the second screen experience,
but according to
the second screen experience,
other people are loving the show.
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>You didn't tell me
there would be another celebrity.
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p>Well, I had no idea that was coming
but some guy named Dong-Slinger-420
loved the surprise.
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>He said, "Two dongs way up."
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>There was no mention of another bigger
celebrity in the document you faxed?
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>I couldn't read it. My fax machine
cut it into little strips.
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>-That sounds like a shredder.
-Well, I guess I shredded it to you.

<p>-No, sorry, I'm not a, uh-- I'm an actor.
-Oh, good for you.
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>It's a dreadful business
but hang in there.
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p>No, I already did hang in there.
I'm BoJack Horseman?
</p><timestamp>00:09:38</timestamp>
<p>We've actually met before.
</p><timestamp>00:09:39</timestamp>
<p>At Chris Martin's holiday party?
We stepped outside for a smoke?
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p>-To get away from Chris Martin?
-Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>You opened up
about your fear of success?
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>I gave you some advice?
</p><timestamp>00:09:48</timestamp>
<p>You said I was a true friend
and you would never forget me?
</p><timestamp>00:09:51</timestamp>
<p>And you said your name
was Chadwick Boseman?
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack Horseman.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:09:56</timestamp>
<p>When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people.
</p><timestamp>00:09:59</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, we need you guys back on set.

assistant on <i>The Ellen Show</i>
about five years ago.
Veronica, right?
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, that's right.
-How was your mother's party in the end?
</p><timestamp>00:10:09</timestamp>
<p>And we're back in five, four,
three, two...

<p>Hello. Serious,
Going-Places Todd at your service.
</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>Hey, look at you, all dressed up
for the Dipshit Awards.
</p><timestamp>00:10:38</timestamp>
<p>You know you're not allowed
in Hair and Makeup.
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>-Are you wearing roller skates?
-I'm wearing Heelys.
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>They're shoes with wheels,

<p>-Now I can be serious faster.
-You can also go nowhere faster.
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>

<p>No!

-Oh, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>Another embarrassingly
wrong answer,
bringing your score down
by 80 points and 12 dollars.
</p><timestamp>00:11:03</timestamp>
<p>Why are we playing
for both points and dollars?
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, tough break, B.J. Novak!
-My name is--
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>Our next question is to Mr. Radcliffe.
</p><timestamp>00:11:10</timestamp>
<p>"What color comes from
the combination of blue and yellow?"
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>I actually know this one.
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p>When I was growing up,
my neighbor was a painter.
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>I remember visiting his flat
and watching him work.
</p><timestamp>00:11:21</timestamp>
<p>Sometimes he would mix together
blue paint with yellow paint
and it made an entirely new color.
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p>And that man was Banksy.
And that color was green.
</p><timestamp>00:11:28</timestamp>
<p>-Final answer.
-Correct!
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>You've earned
the chance to go for a spin

</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, splendid.
</p><timestamp>00:11:39</timestamp>
<p>And while Daniel's in the booth,
BoJack, you have an essay question.
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-You'll find a blue book on your podium.
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>"To what extent was feudalism
a cause of the French Revolution?"

<p>While BoJack works,

<p>-on our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth Cam.
-<subtitle>audience cheers</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, champ.
-What are you doing here?
</p><timestamp>00:11:57</timestamp>
<p>I'm trying to write an essay.
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>I came to ask you how you were doing
and then to tell you
you're not doing so well.
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p>Why am I getting
the hard questions,
while Boy Wizard over there
just has to know colors
and literally grab cash out of thin air?
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Daniel laughs</subtitle> A five! This is so easy!
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>I think I might be able to help you out.
Let me tell you a story.
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p><i>The year was 2003</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p><i>and for some reason, everyone was</i>
<i>playing poker all of a sudden.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:20</timestamp>
<p><i>A then-relevant Wilmer Valderrama</i>
<i>used to host a weekly how-do-you-do</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p><i>and all the stars</i>
<i>came out to show off their tricks.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p><i>There was Lucy Lawless, Lucy Liu,</i>
<i>Lori Laughlin, Lisa Loeb,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p><i>the dog from </i>Frasier,
<i>and at the head of the table?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p><i>Big Money himself, Mr. Peanutbutter.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p>Whoops. Woh-oh.
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p><i>I thought, "Here's a rube."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p><i>But Lady Luck had other plans.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>You know what,
I got an essay to write,
so if this isn't about the precipitous
fall of the French ruling class--
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p><i>But then I saw, the kid had a tell.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>I feel like that story had a lot
of unnecessary details in it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>Listen. You have to pay close attention,
it's subtle,
but when he gets excited, his ears ever
so slightly flop up and give him away.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>Well, that's no surprise. Guy's been
flopping upwards his whole career.
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>Mm-hm. Watch the ears.
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>horn blows</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>Time's up, Daniel.
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, looks like D to the R
to the Ad to the Cliffe
just won 54,000 bonus dollars.
</p><timestamp>00:13:27</timestamp>
<p>And BoJack barely got beyond
his thesis statement.

</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's gonna cost
you some serious pesos.
</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>But first, it's time for
our Multiple Choice Buzz-In Round.
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>A buzz-in round? All right.
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>In is my favorite direction
in which to buzz.
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>Tell me, "How many oak trees are needed
to build an 18th century triple-decker

</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>A, 75? B, 1000?
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>Or C, 3500?"
</p><timestamp>00:14:02</timestamp>
<p>C! 3500!
</p><timestamp>00:14:04</timestamp>
<p>-Um, correct.
-Uh, what?
</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p>-Uh, wow. That's, uh...

</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>

<p>What an amazing run.
It looks like we've got a tied game.
</p><timestamp>00:14:32</timestamp>
<p>Which is an exciting surprise.
</p><timestamp>00:14:35</timestamp>
<p>-Goddamn it, throw to commercial.

<p><subtitle>lively music playing over speakers</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:40</timestamp>
<p>-Hey. Horshack. What's going on?
-What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yeah, you know, you're doing great,
but I'm supposed to win.
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That was the deal.
Plug my movie, win money for charity.
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, tell Charity she can kiss my ass.
</p><timestamp>00:14:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}By the way,
your girlfriend has a stripper name.
</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It's not my girlfriend, it's charity.
</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, according to this app,
you're almost tied.
</p><timestamp>00:15:03</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you are tied, there's a lag.
Congratulations.
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>Thanks. It was touch and go--
</p><timestamp>00:15:08</timestamp>
<p>But I'm a little concerned
because it seems like
you might actually win,
but everyone on the app
is really rooting for Daniel.
</p><timestamp>00:15:15</timestamp>
<p>People love him.
</p><timestamp>00:15:16</timestamp>
<p>I guess he was in some movie about a
potter or a Pottery Barn or something?
</p><timestamp>00:15:20</timestamp>
<p>-Are you asking me to throw the game?
-You don't care about this game.
</p><timestamp>00:15:23</timestamp>
<p>The only reason you're here is for me,
so maybe you could help me out?
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Okay.
-You know what?
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>You're the best, no matter
what everybody on this app says.
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>They say you're the worst. Especially
Queefburglar69. He's their leader.

<p>"You may or may not be familiar with a
famous racehorse named Secretariat.

win the Triple Crown?"

<p>-<subtitle>audience and Daniel laughing</subtitle>
-What? No, not even close.
</p><timestamp>00:16:04</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, aren't you in a movie
about Secretariat?
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>-How could you not know that?
-Let's just move on.
</p><timestamp>00:16:11</timestamp>
<p>Maybe instead,
he should be in a movie
about a guy who doesn't know
anything about Secretariat. <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:16</timestamp>
<p>That would not be a good movie.
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>I mean, more like Secre-terrible.
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Damn, Bojangles, you got served.
</p><timestamp>00:16:24</timestamp>
<p>Do you know anything about Secretariat?
You know he was a horse, right?
</p><timestamp>00:16:28</timestamp>
<p>Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you?
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>No wonder my wife
had to write your book for you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p>Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking
about your wife, I've got a question.
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>
<p>How come your wife flew
all the way to war-torn Cordovia
just to get away from you?
</p><timestamp>00:16:42</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>people murmuring</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>
<p>That's not what happened.
She went to help people.
</p><timestamp>00:16:46</timestamp>
<p>Or maybe she went to help herself
get away from her awful marriage.
</p><timestamp>00:16:49</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>audience gasping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, was that too far?

</p><timestamp>00:16:54</timestamp>
<p>-Well, I mean--
-No, no, no, let's get into things.
</p><timestamp>00:16:57</timestamp>
<p>Let's get real.
Everybody, BoJack wants to get real.
</p><timestamp>00:17:01</timestamp>
<p>Cancel the Bubble Round.
Because we're getting real.

<p>Should we cut to commercial?

by the sirens' song?

<p>No?

<p>Well, there you are.
</p><timestamp>00:17:16</timestamp>
<p>Things are getting real out here.
Really real.

<p>-Uh, I'm not sure where you're going--
-Oh, no?
</p><timestamp>00:17:26</timestamp>
<p>You knew
where you were going with my wife
that time you pulled over
by the side of the road.
</p><timestamp>00:17:31</timestamp>
<p>-You know, a week before we got married?
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>You want to talk about that, BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>You want to talk about the time when you,
my "good friend," kissed my wife?
</p><timestamp>00:17:40</timestamp>
<p>-No!
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>Did something
exciting just happen?
</p><timestamp>00:17:43</timestamp>
<p>Because people on the app are,
and I quote, "losing their tits."
</p><timestamp>00:17:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no, no, I've stumbled on to
a cancer support message board.
</p><timestamp>00:17:50</timestamp>
<p>Okay, how do I...?
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>How did you know about that?
</p><timestamp>00:17:53</timestamp>
<p>Well, there are roadside cameras
all along the PCH,
</p><timestamp>00:17:56</timestamp>
<p>I have a few friends
in the highway patrol,
and she told me, of course! We're married!

<p>Wait, so you've known all this time?

<p>Um, don't you think
you're pushing them too far?

</p><timestamp>00:18:26</timestamp>
<p>You think I don't notice?
Why don't you like me?
</p><timestamp>00:18:28</timestamp>
<p>-Mr. Peanutbutter--

</p><timestamp>00:18:31</timestamp>
<p>-Because... I'm jealous.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>-Of what? Diane?
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:18:37</timestamp>
<p>Of everything.
Everything comes so easy for you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:40</timestamp>
<p>Oh, and it doesn't for you?
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>You're a millionaire movie star
with a girlfriend who loves you,
acting in your dream movie.
What more do you want?
</p><timestamp>00:18:49</timestamp>
<p>What else could
the universe possibly owe you?
</p><timestamp>00:18:52</timestamp>
<p>I want to feel good about myself.
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>
<p>The way you do.
And I don't know how.
</p><timestamp>00:19:00</timestamp>
<p>I don't know if I can.
</p><timestamp>00:19:02</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, guys, this is getting
a little heavy, don't we think?
</p><timestamp>00:19:05</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p>I can't tell you how sorry I am.

<p>Wow, um, I don't know
if I can forgive you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:14</timestamp>

<p>I knew it. I knew this show would
bring us to the heights of human drama
more powerfully than literature
ever dreamed.
</p><timestamp>00:19:30</timestamp>
<p>Now somebody go out and get me
a Red Bull and a banana fish sandwich.
</p><timestamp>00:19:34</timestamp>

<p>-Mr. Peanutbutter!
-Oh, hey Wanda.
</p><timestamp>00:19:41</timestamp>
<p>I'm only half paying attention
to whatever you two are arguing about
but it's killer.
Now all we need is a happy ending.
</p><timestamp>00:19:47</timestamp>
<p>I don't think we can just resolve
everything cleanly in a half-hour.
</p><timestamp>00:19:50</timestamp>
<p>Uh, this is network television.
</p><timestamp>00:19:52</timestamp>
<p>So resolving everything cleanly
in a half-hour is kind of what we do.
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>You want to host a game show where
everyone feels bad at the end?
</p><timestamp>00:20:00</timestamp>
<p>You can get in your little car, drive to
Santa Monica and pitch it to AMC.
</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>But these people want resolution, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:20:06</timestamp>
<p>So you get your little butt back
on that stage and you resolve.

<p>You know, during the break,
my producers told me
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>I had to forgive BoJack
live on the air.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>audience booing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>But I'm my own dog.
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>And as my own dog, I decided
to forgive BoJack live on the air!
Bring it in, buddy!
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Really?
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter,
I applaud your forgiving nature,
but this guy kissed your wife.
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>Wait, BoJack kissed Diane?
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>The only way to even the score
is if you get to kiss him.
</p><timestamp>00:21:23</timestamp>
<p>-Wait, what?
-You're right, it makes perfect sense.
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, absolutely.
-No, it doesn't.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>That way Diane and I will have
had the same experience.
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>It's the only way we can move past this.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>Well, if it helps us move past this,
I guess...
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Daniel and audience</subtitle> Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>J.D.</subtitle> Cue the Kiss Cam.

</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>Oh, if only I'd had a Kiss Cam
for <i>Catcher In The Rye.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>Well, just one more regret
on a long list of many.
</p><timestamp>00:21:57</timestamp>
<p>Todd, there you are. You're missing
a pretty big moment out there.
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>I don't care. You said it yourself.
Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>Not for nothing, but you were worthless
before you didn't get the pen.
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>I really tried this time. I guess
I'll never really amount to anything.
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>Well, maybe you just need
someone to believe in you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>Wow, no one's ever
fallen for that!
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-You're so stupid!
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>You had the pen
and you just gave it to me?!
</p><timestamp>00:22:30</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I can't believe that worked.
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, look at your stupid face.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>The pen is just a symbol.
It doesn't--
</p><timestamp>00:22:38</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, said the girl
who doesn't have a pen right now.
</p><timestamp>00:22:41</timestamp>
<p>Unbelievable. You are the most annoying,
immature, aggravating,
irritating, crazy-making...
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh, she was mad, all right. But kids?
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p>That's the story of
how I met... this pen.
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>Hey, get out of Hair and Makeup
and give me back my pen!
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>I got your pen.
That means you respect me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>-No it does not.
-Viva Todd-foolery!
</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p>Suck a dick, dumbshits.
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>-Hey! Hey, hey!

<p>Well, that stern but supple kiss
puts you over the top.

<p>BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.

<p>-Well played, Jock-jam Door-slam.

</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>You've earned $500,000 for charity.
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>You can walk away right now
or, and remember, this is for charity,
you can risk it all in
our Double or Nothing round.
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>audience clamoring</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I wanna risk it all!
</p><timestamp>00:23:36</timestamp>
<p>All right. Now that's $500,000.
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p>If you get this question right,
you double that,
a million dollars for charity.
</p><timestamp>00:23:44</timestamp>
<p>But if you get it wrong,
the charity gets nothing
and all the money will be set on fire
live here on our studio soundstage.
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, for all the marbles:
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p>"Which famous actor
played the titular role
in the popular <i>Harry Potter</i>
film franchise?"
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>audience</subtitle> Oh.
-Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:24:03</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:24:05</timestamp>
<p>When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people,
it's impossible to remember them all.
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I get what you're doing. Very funny.
</p><timestamp>00:24:13</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Oh, what is that guy's name?
</p><timestamp>00:24:16</timestamp>
<p>You know, it's on the tip of my tongue?
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>
<p>Are you serious right now?
Dude, this is for charity.
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack, we need an answer.
-Yeah, I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:24:24</timestamp>
<p>Gosh, I wanna say...
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p>-Elijah Wood?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Elijah Wood?!
