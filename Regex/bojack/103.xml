<p>Well, those boobs

you got to give the people
what they want,
even if it kills you,
even if it empties you out until
there's nothing left to empty.
</p><timestamp>00:01:39</timestamp>
<p>No matter what happens,
no matter how much it hurts,
you don't stop dancing,
and you don't stop smiling,

<p>When we started dating,
you were the biggest star

</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>Where's Sarah Lynn now?
</p><timestamp>00:06:57</timestamp>
<p>I checked her into Promises.
28 days, she'll be good as new.

you raised on television
into rehab?

</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>I would have liked
to reconnect with her.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>At least we got to bond a little
on the drive to Malibu.

though, huh?

<p>Well, maybe the two of you
can catch up some more
when she gets out of rehab.

hang out with me after rehab.

<p>No one has ever said "no" to me,
ever, so is it cool
if instead of confronting
my problems head on,

<p>I just hide out here

<p>Sarah Lynn,
I hear what you're saying,
and I think I know
what you need.

<p>I didn't realize you were

</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>Look, I asked her
to turn it down, but apparently,
this volume was prescribed
by Dr. Who
to treat something called
"uptight dickhead disease."
</p><timestamp>00:12:20</timestamp>
<p>What do you-- What do you think
about Sarah Lynn?
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I don't really think
about her all that much.
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>I mean, obviously,
I'm a fan of her early work
which both satirized
and celebrated
youth culture's obsession
with sex,
but I do wonder
as a third-wave feminist
if it's even possible for women
to reclaim their sexuality
in this deeply entrenched
patriarchal society,
or if claiming to do so
is just a lie we tell ourselves
so we can more comfortably cater
to the male gaze.
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>- Uh, what?
- But you know,
on the other hand, I worry
that conversations like this one
often dismiss her as a mere
puppet of the industry...
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>- That's my same worry.
- ...incapable of engaging
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>- in these discussions herself...
- Obviously.
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p>...and infantilization,
which is itself a product
</p><timestamp>00:12:56</timestamp>
<p>- of the deeply misogynistic...
- So deep.
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p>...society we live in.
But like I said,
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>I don't really think about her
all that much.
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well,
that is very interesting,
but I was more asking,
like, what do you think
about her living here?
</p><timestamp>00:13:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh, right.
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>
<p>Well, what was
your relationship like
with her when you were working
on the show?
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>It was very good,
very professional.
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>BoJack,
where did you go to college?
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>- Don't bother him, honey.
- Oh, it's no problem.
</p><timestamp>00:13:21</timestamp>
<p>Honey, college is for
ugly people who can't tap dance.

</p><timestamp>00:13:27</timestamp>
<p>Mommy didn't do what Mommy did
to that <i>Star Search </i>producer
so that you could be
an architect.
</p><timestamp>00:13:32</timestamp>
<p>- Aw.
- All right,
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>- take it sleazy, everybody.
- Wait, BoJack,
um, what are you doing
this weekend?
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>I don't know.
I'll probably just go
to the amusement park,
maybe the circus,
fly a kite on the beach,
watch the sunset,
then I'll head
back to my place
to watch any number
of Disney princess movies
while eating ice cream
straight from the tub.
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, that sounds like

</p><timestamp>00:14:14</timestamp>
<p>No, Diane,
I'm just helping out a friend.
</p><timestamp>00:14:16</timestamp>
<p>I'm not trying to play out
some weird, sick dad fantasy,
or resolve a deep guilt
for past neglect,
or even try to retroactively fix
my own childhood

and I'm especially not doing
all those things at once!

<p>Sarah Lynn! Ah!
What the--?
</p><timestamp>00:14:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, hey, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>I told my friends they could
tear this wall out to build
a sweet cocaine booth/sex
closet.
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>- Is that cool?
- No, that's not cool.
</p><timestamp>00:14:45</timestamp>
<p>Oof. Way to harsh the vibe,
Kissinger.
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>
<p>I thought this was a place
where Sarah Lynn
could finally be Sarah Lynn,
but I guess...
that's too much, man.
</p><timestamp>00:14:58</timestamp>
<p>I always loved
that catch phrase.
</p><timestamp>00:15:01</timestamp>
<p>Can your friends at least take
the artwork off the wall first?
</p><timestamp>00:15:04</timestamp>
<p>Ooh.
I want to say yes, but no.
</p><timestamp>00:15:08</timestamp>
<p>- Okay, good talk.
- Wha-- Are you serious?
</p><timestamp>00:15:16</timestamp>
<p>The reason I have called
this house meeting is--
</p><timestamp>00:15:19</timestamp>
<p>Todd, how many times
have we been over this?
</p><timestamp>00:15:21</timestamp>
<p>You don't have the authority
to call house meetings.
</p><timestamp>00:15:23</timestamp>
<p>Only I can call a house meeting.
You can propose a house meeting.
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>All right, fine, fine, fine,
but the reason I propose
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>- this house meeting--
- Your proposal has been
submitted and
is under board review.
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p>- Proposal denied.
- BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thing
is getting out of control, okay?
She's taking advantage of you.
</p><timestamp>00:15:39</timestamp>
<p>What? No she's not.
We have a special relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:15:41</timestamp>
<p>You couldn't possibly
understand.
</p><timestamp>00:15:43</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God. Look at what
she's done to your house.
</p><timestamp>00:15:45</timestamp>
<p>All right, look, I mean,
I stepped on a needle earlier.
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p>I think I'm addicted
to heroin now,
so now, that's probably
gonna be a whole thing.
</p><timestamp>00:15:52</timestamp>
<p>I have to say,
I agree with Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:15:54</timestamp>
<p>You're not this girl's father,
and you're not doing her
any favors by refusing
to set boundaries.
</p><timestamp>00:15:57</timestamp>
<p>Look, I played a dad
for nine years on TV,
so I think I know a little bit
more about parenting
than you two jokers.
The kids on <i>Horsin' Around</i>
didn't need boundaries.
</p><timestamp>00:16:06</timestamp>
<p>All they needed was
some good, old-fashioned love.
</p><timestamp>00:16:08</timestamp>
<p>BoJack!
This is not a TV show, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:16:11</timestamp>
<p>This is real life.
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>
<p>Ah! Lemur on fire!
Lemur on fire!
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>Some good, old-fashioned love,
and I'm gonna give it to her.
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna give it to her
so... hard.
</p><timestamp>00:16:26</timestamp>
<p>You know, I feel like
we don't ever hang out.
</p><timestamp>00:16:31</timestamp>
<p>Here you are, milady,
a gin and nutmeg
just like you asked.
</p><timestamp>00:16:36</timestamp>

Too much nutmeg.
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>

the feeling in my fingers.
</p><timestamp>00:21:01</timestamp>
<p>That was the longest two minutes
of my life.
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>Um, I think it was a little
longer than two minutes.
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>It was longer
than two minutes.
</p><timestamp>00:21:07</timestamp>
<p>How do you not get
that this is terrible?
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you mean
from a P.R. standpoint?
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, 'cause if this got out,
oh, I would get flayed!
</p><timestamp>00:21:15</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I'm done being
the voice of reason.
</p><timestamp>00:21:18</timestamp>
<p>It's exhausting.
I got to take an angry nap.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:21:24</timestamp>
<p>I know. I know.
She's taking advantage of me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:27</timestamp>
<p>Actually, it kind of feels
like you're the one
taking advantage of her.
She's the one
with substance abuse problems
and daddy issues.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>Hey, we both have
substance abuse problems
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>- and daddy issues.
- Yeah, but she came to you
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>- for help.
- <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p>Hey, notice how
I've been ignoring you,
playing hard to get?
Only makes you want me more.
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. Go stand
on the other side of the room.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>- Okay.
- Sarah Lynn, get your coat.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>- I'm taking you to rehab.
- Nah,
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>I was gonna keep hanging out
here if that's all right.
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>- No, it's not all right.
- What?
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>This place isn't good
for you.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>You need to go where you can
get help, real help.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>But I thought you were always
gonna be there for me
like you said.
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>I will always
be there for you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>Cut, let's take ten.
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>That's ten, everyone.
Let's make it a tight ten.
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>- These pages are shit.
- <subtitle>coughs</subtitle>
you understand?
Shit.
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>I wouldn't wipe my ass
with these pages.
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>It would defeat the whole
purpose of wiping my ass.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>- Phone for you.
- Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>You get me points
on the back end?
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>coughs</subtitle>
- Well, I told you
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna do it
unless I get points.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>Oh, they can't find any?
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>Well, maybe they could
suck some out of my dick!
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>coughs</subtitle>
- I'm on the phone.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>- You're being very rude.
- <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>You promised me you would
always be there.
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>Sarah Lynn,
this is for your own good.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>You can't stay here anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>Okie-doke.
I guess I'll just move out
and find
one of the billion people
who will let me party
at their house.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>Uh, well,
you should not do that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:45</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I know. I know,
but I can, so I will.
</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p>I'm at a place right now
where I never need
to grow as a person
or rise to an occasion
because I can constantly
just surround myself
with sycophants and enablers
until I die tragically young.
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>- Wh-What?
- Yeah,
it's pretty much
too late for me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>Well, them's the breaks.
Take it sleazy, everybody.
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>Oh, by the way,
I called Vanessa Gecko,
and I'm meeting with her
tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p>- Thanks for the suggestion.
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
</p><timestamp>00:23:13</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you guys want to hear
my new catchphrase?
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>Suck a dick, dumb shits!
<subtitle>blows raspberry</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>Laura, the dummy took the bait.
Now for phase two.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>Is she gone?
Is it safe to come out?
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p>Leak to the trades
that Andrew Garfield's agent
is taking meetings with his ex,
get it all over town,
wait an hour,
then get me lunch with Andrew
on the books for this weekend,
someplace Italian.
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p>I really blew it,
didn't I?
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>I mean, maybe you could
have been a better role model
when she was young, but also,
she never really had a chance.
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>This is what our celebrity
culture does to people.
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>So what you're saying is,
Everything is society's fault,
and we as individuals
never need
to take responsibility
for anything?
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>Uh, no. Not exactly.
I was just saying that--
</p><timestamp>00:23:59</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I like that.
I didn't do anything wrong
because I can't do
anything wrong
because we're all just products
of our environment,
bouncing around like marbles
in the game
of Hungry Hungry Hippos
that is our random
and cruel universe.
</p><timestamp>00:24:09</timestamp>
<p>Wait, no, that's not even
what I'm saying--
</p><timestamp>00:24:11</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, It's not my fault.
It's society.
</p><timestamp>00:24:14</timestamp>
<p>Everything is
because of society!
</p><timestamp>00:24:16</timestamp>
<p>- BoJack, that--
- Dude, just let him have this.
</p><timestamp>00:24:19</timestamp>
<p>Hooray!
Everything is meaningless!
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p><i>Nothing I do</i>
<i>has consequence!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:24:26</timestamp>
<p>So what'd you get,
anything good?
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I got everything.
