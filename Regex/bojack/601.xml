</p><timestamp>00:00:07</timestamp>
<p><i>Sarah Lynn?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>stammers</subtitle> <i>I don't have a lot to tell.</i>
<i>She called me.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p><i>She sounded a little off. I... </i><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p><i>So, I drove to the planetarium,</i>
<i>and I found her passed out.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p><i>I called 911 right away,</i>
<i>but it was too late.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>crickets chirping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:31</timestamp>
<p>-I'm so sorry.
-<subtitle>cries</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>I did everything I could.
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>It's my fault. I'm a terrible mother.
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>-No. It's no one's fault.
-<subtitle>sobs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p>So, you don't know
where Sarah Lynn got the heroin from?
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>-I have no idea.
-Alrighty then.
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>That's the only question I had.
</p><timestamp>00:00:51</timestamp>
<p>I mean, of course I knew
she was doing a lot of drugs.
</p><timestamp>00:00:54</timestamp>
<p>But that's who she was. Who I was.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>It felt like we could keep
partying forever
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>-and it wouldn't catch up with us.
-Got it. Don't need any more information.
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>I was in a bad way.
</p><timestamp>00:01:02</timestamp>
<p>And Sarah Lynn followed me down
because she thought I was a safe place.
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p>What have I done?
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p>Just to be clear, the case is closed.
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>You can stop rambling.
</p><timestamp>00:01:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>whistles tune</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:15</timestamp>
<p>I gotta make some changes in my life.
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>Starting now.

</p><timestamp>00:01:39</timestamp>
<p>-I need help. Hello? Ah!
-Checking in.
</p><timestamp>00:01:42</timestamp>
<p>-Welcome to Pastiches Malibu!
-Great.
</p><timestamp>00:01:44</timestamp>
<p>I see you have the six-week package, so...
a hundred thousand dollars, please!
</p><timestamp>00:01:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A hundred thou-- Jesus!
</p><timestamp>00:01:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Does every room come
with a free bag full of $90,000?
</p><timestamp>00:01:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Can't put a price on clean living.
-And yet somehow you found a way.
</p><timestamp>00:01:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Before I take you to your room,
could we get a selfie?
</p><timestamp>00:01:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What? No.
</p><timestamp>00:02:01</timestamp>
<p>Every client that comes here
takes a picture with me.
</p><timestamp>00:02:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Goes on the wall. Kind of a tradition...
</p><timestamp>00:02:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm not in the mood.
I look awful, first of all.
</p><timestamp>00:02:10</timestamp>
<p>Johnny Depp did it, and he looked
just as puffy and ghoulish as you do.
</p><timestamp>00:02:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hey, groundhog. I said no.
Why don't you go see your own shadow
</p><timestamp>00:02:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so I can get six more weeks
of "Leave Me the Hell Alone"?
</p><timestamp>00:02:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm so sorry, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:02:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Thank you.
Now if you'll kindly direct me to my room,
</p><timestamp>00:02:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I would like to begin
the process of healing,
</p><timestamp>00:02:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so I can finally stop hurting
the people around me, dipshit!

<p>So, when I went to the country club
for Sheila's luncheon...
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>Yes. Let it out.
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I had to wear the same suit
I had just worn to Sandra's tea party.
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Yeah.
-<subtitle>woman</subtitle> Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:04:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I think of that as my rock bottom. <subtitle>sobs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>Denise, thank you
for sharing your story. So brave.
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>Denise, we are powerless
</p><timestamp>00:04:16</timestamp>
<p>-over our addictions
-Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We have a saying in rehab,
"Everyone takes a different road
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}to get to the same city,
Soberopolis, USA."
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>Hold on a sec. What?
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}BoJack, maybe you could tell us
when was the first time you drank?
</p><timestamp>00:04:27</timestamp>
<p>When wasn't the first time I drank?
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Am I right?
-<subtitle>all laugh</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>Your last day's tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>You think you're ready
to go back into the world?
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>I do. I feel good, I feel clear.
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>You know, just because you cleaned
the tobacco out of your teeth
don't mean it's your wedding day,
pardon the expression.
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>I don't believe that is an expression.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>I notice you tend to deflect
whenever I ask you
about the source of your addiction.
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>I don't deflect.
Hey, is that a new tie? Because I love it.
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>You understand a joke about deflection
is still a deflection, right?
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>I came here to take responsibility
for myself,
and all I keep hearing is,
"It's not your fault,
you are powerless over your addiction."
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>-That is the first step.
-And while we're at it, why 12 steps?
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>That is way too many.
Nobody wants to do 12 of anything.
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>Did you see <i>12 Years a Slave</i>
and think, "Twelve. That's a short number
of years to be a slave"?
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>-You're deflecting again.
-I'm here because I made choices.
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>Nobody made me drink.
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>My addiction didn't pull a knife on me
and say, "Hey, bub! Drink this alcohol,
or I'm gonna strangle you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>After I put down this knife,
which now seems unnecessary."
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>-We have a saying in the sober community.
-No kidding.
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>"We want what our addictions
want us to want,
in the same way that our future
is just a house built from the materials
of our present on the blueprint
that is our past."
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>See, usually the point of sayings
is they illustrate complicated concepts
via straightforward allegory.
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>I really admire
that your sayings don't do that.
</p><timestamp>00:05:46</timestamp>
<p>If you don't wanna be here,
you don't have to wait until tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>The gate code is 12,
for the number of steps,
then my mom's birthday,
which is March 4th, '56.
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>So, the gate code
is one, two, three, four, five, six?
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>You can leave whenever you'd like.
But is that really what you want?
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> No.
</p><timestamp>00:06:07</timestamp>
<p>It's so beautiful.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>And I know a lot about art
because my husband owns
a Jackson Pollock. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>My dad owns a signed picture
of Kevin Pollak.
</p><timestamp>00:06:16</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>yelps</subtitle>
-What about you, BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>Did you grow up in a house
with a lot of art?
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>Well, my parents practiced
the art of being terrible parents.
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, you can't joke your way
through this.
</p><timestamp>00:06:26</timestamp>
<p>Everyone else in this group
is trying hard to be honest.
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>Really? Everyone's being honest?
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>Doug over here,
who keeps dressing in a suit and tie
even though he's never getting
his finance job back?
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>woman gasps</subtitle>
-Oh! Savage!
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>And Joan Tripplehorn?
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>We all know you're just Jeanne Tripplehorn
wearing fake glasses!
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
-<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> What? No!
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>I'm Jeanne's identical twin Joan.
</p><timestamp>00:06:47</timestamp>
<p>Mm, Jeanne Tripplehorn. Not an alcoholic.
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>And that guy with the fake mustache
is obviously actor Jay Hernandez
who's just here to do research for a role.
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
-No. I'm a no "Hernandez."
</p><timestamp>00:06:57</timestamp>
<p>Like I say, my name is Mario.
Directed by Zack Snyder.
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm addicted to pain pills from breaking
too many bricks on my head.
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>BoJack's right! You all suck!
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, well, let's talk about Jameson.
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>-I'd rather you not.
-She would love to get sober
but still has her friend McCaitlyn
sneak her water bottles
filled with vodka every visiting day.
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
-Jameson?
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>-Um...
-Have you been smuggling in alcohol?
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>How is this my fault?
I blame water for being vodka-colored!
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>This is your fifth time in rehab.
</p><timestamp>00:07:24</timestamp>
<p>-Maybe it's a sign it's not working, huh?
-BoJack...
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>Everyone, just as a general rule,
if you're checking into rehab
more than once,
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>-either you're a lost cause...
-<subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>...or this is just an industry
that profits off of repeat customers,
so maybe they don't have
your best interest at heart.
</p><timestamp>00:07:39</timestamp>
<p>-Oh!
-How's that for honest?
</p><timestamp>00:07:42</timestamp>
<p>Mamma mia.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>blows</subtitle>
-<subtitle>door opens</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>Hey, snitch! I only sneak in vodka
because I have to make it through
six weeks of this bullshit.
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>I don't even need to be here.
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>My dad totally overreacted
when he found me not breathing.
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, it's always
someone else's fault, right?
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>-You have no idea what I've been through.
-I know everything you've been through.
</p><timestamp>00:08:03</timestamp>
<p>I listen in group!
Your mom died of cancer.
</p><timestamp>00:08:05</timestamp>
<p>Your dad stuck you in boarding school
and remarried.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>And now there's a new baby
and no one pays attention to you.
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>But it's not his fault
you're drinking in rehab.
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>I was sober for most of last year
and he just waited for me to slip up
so he could ship me here
so I wouldn't embarrass him
and ruin his new perfect family--
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>Hey, if you don't wanna be here,
the gate code is one, two,
three, four, five, six.
</p><timestamp>00:08:22</timestamp>
<p>You could sneak out the upstairs window
after midnight bed check
by tying your sheets into a rope
and nobody would notice
you're gone until wake-up.
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>But... is that what you really want?
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>door closes</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>studio audience laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>Holy sheet!
</p><timestamp>00:08:41</timestamp>
<p>I've heard of being at the end
of my rope...
but this is ridiculous!
</p><timestamp>00:08:46</timestamp>
<p>Why would Sabrina run away like that?
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>Because I had to break it to her that you
weren't going to be her new mommy,
international supermodel Cindy Crawfish!
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>When I was flying to Paris
for Paris Fashion Week
and my private plane crashed
into your backyard,
the one thing I never expected
was to find someone so special.
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>-Oh.
-<subtitle>both chuckle</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>audience</subtitle> Aw!
</p><timestamp>00:09:08</timestamp>
<p>-Cut! That's a five, everyone!
-<subtitle>bell ringing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:12</timestamp>
<p>So, look, you're doing everything great.
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>I'm loving your instincts, it's dead on,
couldn't be better, perfect.
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>The one problem is the kiss got an "aw."
</p><timestamp>00:09:20</timestamp>
<p>It's supposed to get an "Ooh!"
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>-Right?
-I'm nervous, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:09:26</timestamp>
<p>This is my first on-camera kiss,
and it's with Cindy Crawfish.
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>You know how many guys would kill
to be in your shoes?
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>What do I gotta do?
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>Kiss you on the lips myself
to show you what a real kiss looks like?
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>kisses</subtitle>
-Ha-ha-ha!
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>-No. I'll handle it.
-Well, I sure as hell hope so.
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gulps</subtitle> Mm.
</p><timestamp>00:09:43</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, what's in this orange juice?
-Just a little extra punch.
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>Oh. No, no, I don't--
</p><timestamp>00:09:48</timestamp>
<p>Trust me. It'll loosen you up.
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>The one thing I never expected...
was to find someone so special.
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Cindy</subtitle> Hmm!
-<subtitle>audience</subtitle> Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Herb</subtitle> Love it! Cut and scene!
-<subtitle>bell ringing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:05</timestamp>
<p>Hey, no way, the party's just beginning.
Let's do one more take!
</p><timestamp>00:10:10</timestamp>
<p>-You up for more acting, Cindy?
-<subtitle>audience whooping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>Well, if it's for the show.
</p><timestamp>00:10:15</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Sharona,
how 'bout some more of that OJ?
</p><timestamp>00:10:21</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Jameson grunting</subtitle> Whoa! Ow.
-Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:10:24</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>panting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:10:42</timestamp>
<p>I was just trying to come up
with one of those dumb rehab sayings!
</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>
<p>McCaitlyn told me Dathan
was thinking of breaking up with me
because I got fat junior year.
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>So, I need to go show him
that I'm back to being hot.
</p><timestamp>00:10:51</timestamp>
<p>Then break up with him
for being a shallow buck foy!
</p><timestamp>00:10:53</timestamp>
<p>You don't need to do that.
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>Oh, what does it matter?
We both know this place is bullshit!
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>So, why do you care what I do?
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>Because I'm the idiot
who helped you escape.
</p><timestamp>00:11:01</timestamp>
<p>So, if you OD tonight,
then I'm the one who'll have to lie
to everyone about what happened.
</p><timestamp>00:11:05</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm going.
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>

-I'll be fine.
</p><timestamp>00:11:25</timestamp>
<p>I'll just find Dathan,
crush him with my thigh gap,
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>-and then we can go.

<p>You're still doing it!
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>-I tried to make it easy on you, Jameson.

<p>Do not touch her boob!

<p>Jameson, it's not my fault you're a mess.
</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>I mean, how many times

</p><timestamp>00:14:14</timestamp>
<p>-And your friend sucks.
-No, they're right.
</p><timestamp>00:14:17</timestamp>
<p>I'm a mess. And no one cares.
God damn it! I might as well drink.
</p><timestamp>00:14:20</timestamp>
<p>-No. You don't need a drink.
-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:23</timestamp>
<p>You need to get back to bed
and get some sleep.
</p><timestamp>00:14:24</timestamp>
<p>You're right. I'm gonna go home
and sleep in my bed!
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p>And when my dad shows up
to ask why I'm not in rehab,
</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p>I'll be like, "Maybe <i>you </i>should go
to rehab for <i>your </i>addiction
to being a shitty dad, Dad!"
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>Okay, Jameson,
you need to be responsible for yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>Now, I think that you should come back
to Pastiches with me, like you promised.
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>But if you wanna go to your dad's house,
all you have to do is steal Dathan's car,
and I heard Michele with one "L"
is about to jump naked into the pool,
so everyone's gonna be distracted,
which means this is the perfect time.
</p><timestamp>00:14:53</timestamp>

<p>I need you to find the address

</p><timestamp>00:15:12</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack?
-All I know for sure
is that he's the father of a girl
named Jameson, who's super annoying.
</p><timestamp>00:15:16</timestamp>
<p>I'm going to assume you have a good reason
to locate a girl
in the middle of the night,
but I can't help you.
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>
<p>Fine! Be that way. Todd'll help me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:26</timestamp>
<p>-Can you patch me through to Todd?
-What? Call him yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>I don't know his number.
</p><timestamp>00:15:30</timestamp>
<p>I only remember your number because it was
such a dumb number with all those fours.
</p><timestamp>00:15:34</timestamp>
<p>Four, four, six, four...
</p><timestamp>00:15:36</timestamp>

has a normal amount of fours.

</p><timestamp>00:15:54</timestamp>
<p>Todd, I need you to track down
an address for me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:56</timestamp>
<p>You're the world's best hacker, right?
</p><timestamp>00:15:58</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but not the kind of hacker
you're thinking of.
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p>-Funny story--
-Okay, I gotta go.
</p><timestamp>00:16:02</timestamp>
<p>-I'm at Coachella...
-Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:16:04</timestamp>
<p>Put my name on the wrong list,
suddenly I've entered
into a hacky sack competition!
</p><timestamp>00:16:09</timestamp>
<p>-Right.
-Prior to these events,
</p><timestamp>00:16:11</timestamp>
<p>-I've never hacked a sack in my life.
-Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>
<p>But the only other contender is
the Russian ringer they flew in special,
so I'm thinking,
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>-"I've gotta win this for America!"
-Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>Long story short, the Russian had
a heart attack, so I won by default!
</p><timestamp>00:16:26</timestamp>
<p>Uh, does that answer your question?
</p><timestamp>00:16:28</timestamp>
<p>I don't remember my question,
but I'm gonna guess no.

</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>

is coming together beautifully,
but when I was on break
playing with my model helicopter,
it crashed into the studio water tower.
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, no!
-It gets worse!
</p><timestamp>00:17:00</timestamp>
<p>It flooded the set of former VJ Downtown
Julie Brown's new puppet show.
</p><timestamp>00:17:04</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Completely ruining her vintage
goose-feather dress
she just bought
and disrupting the big finale
where her wooden puppet plays
Beethoven's Fifth on the bongos!

your dumb drone downed a tower

goose-down, hand-me-down gown?

</p><timestamp>00:17:56</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, my dad loves movie memorabilia.
And this car is his baby.
</p><timestamp>00:18:00</timestamp>
<p>At least... No, it was his baby
before the new baby came.
</p><timestamp>00:18:03</timestamp>
<p>Now the new baby's the baby,
which means the car is the new me,
so where does that leave me? Nowhere.
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>What are you talking about?
</p><timestamp>00:18:10</timestamp>
<p>He threw out all of my stuff
and turned my room into the baby's room.
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>He got rid of my softball trophies,
but he loves his stupid bat, naturally.

but this scary old horse made me!
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>Hi, cutie! Mwah!
</p><timestamp>00:20:48</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I'm ready to go back to rehab now.
I'll go wait in the car!
</p><timestamp>00:20:51</timestamp>
<p>Jameson... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>
<p>-Listen--
-Are you drunk or high?
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Are you drunk or high right now?
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry she roped you into this.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>You're not the first guy to help her
break out of that rehab.
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>They always end up at my house.
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>And then they want me to keep quiet
to the press,
so they give me a souvenir
from one of their movies.
</p><timestamp>00:21:09</timestamp>
<p>I could send you a swag bag
from Felicity Huffman's <i>Booty Academy,</i>
but you should probably wash the thong
before wearing it.
</p><timestamp>00:21:15</timestamp>
<p>I don't know what to do with Jameson.
I've tried everything.
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>I thought she would change
after she had her baby, but...
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>baby cooing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:24</timestamp>
<p>Change is hard.
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p>Takes a long time.
</p><timestamp>00:21:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:29</timestamp>
<p>Let me guess,
she wanted to see her boyfriend?
</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>Actually...
she told me she just wanted
to come here to see her baby.
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Wouldn't that be nice?
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>Bye, Daddy! Love you!
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>-Ugh. Sorry my dad's so embarrassing.
-Jesus Christ.
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>You have no idea how lucky you are.
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>I wish I had someone when I was your age
who cared about me enough
to put me in rehab.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, maybe.
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>Well, anyway, thanks for keeping me
out of trouble tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>Really?
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>It was a worth a try.
Ready to sneak back in?
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>I'm getting too old to sneak in
and out of places.
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>All right.
</p><timestamp>00:22:30</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>bell dinging</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>-Checking in?
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>I just snuck out and I'm coming back,
so, you know, put me down
for kitchen clean-up duty
or whatever the punishment is
for sneaking out.
</p><timestamp>00:22:41</timestamp>
<p>No, I don't think you've been here before.
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>
<p>Everyone who's been here before
is humble enough
to take a picture with me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Yeah. Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p>Sign me up for six weeks. Starting now.
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p>-And a picture?
-Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>-Cheese!
