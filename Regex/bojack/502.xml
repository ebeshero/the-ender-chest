<p>Are you okay?
You left my party without saying goodbye.

<p>I was like,
"Uh-oh, what happened to Diane?"
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>-Well--

because Todd got his tongue stuck
to the ice sculpture.
</p><timestamp>00:05:51</timestamp>
<p><i>By the time we got him off,</i>
his tongue was completely numb,
which made him talk real funny.
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>-Mm-hmm.
-Well, that got him in quite the situation
when the mob boss, at the roller rink,
thought he was making fun
of his deaf sister.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry,
this is turning into a Todd story.

<p>Great. Hey, I have to tell you...
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>I'm glad, I'm not still paying
your phone bill

<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> It sure is!
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>I love that we're mature enough
to still be in each other's lives.
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>I know!
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p>Other divorced couples can't handle it,
but we're handling it, so well,
because we are better than them.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>Are we the best divorced couple?
</p><timestamp>00:07:00</timestamp>
<p>-I think we might be.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p>How are you doing
with those divorce papers?
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>-It's been several weeks now-- Aah!
-Hi, folks! I'm Pickles.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>-Ooh!
-Have you dined with us before?
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>-Yes.
-Well...
the way it works around here is:
you look at a menu,
pick what you want, I'll bring it to you,
and then you pay at the end.
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>So, like, a restaurant.
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>-Ooh, sounds great.
-Can I get you started with drinks?
</p><timestamp>00:07:21</timestamp>
<p>Water would be great.
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God, I love water.
-Me, too!
</p><timestamp>00:07:24</timestamp>
<p>-Uh-huh.
-I'm 70 percent water!
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-Me, too! What are the odds?
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>So, two waters. Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>So... Mr. Peanutbutter,
the divorce papers.
</p><timestamp>00:07:34</timestamp>
<p>-We need to-- Aah!
-It's me again, the same dog as before.
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>-Do you know what you'd like to order?
-Are you bringing our waters?
</p><timestamp>00:07:40</timestamp>
<p>-No. I forgot. Food, though?
-Hmm, what do you like here?
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>-No, why would you ask--
-Oh, I like everything.
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>In fact, at the end of my shift,
I usually take everyone's leftover scraps
and put it in a trough and eat it up.
Miam, miam, miam, miam!
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>-But don't mention that to my boss.
-We won't.
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>But that does sound eclectic
and delectable.
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>The trough of everything.
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, and--
-Whoa, somebody's not hungry at all.
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p>-No, I am! I'm very hungry!
-<subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>shouting</subtitle> And I'll have the Cobb salad!
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>-Why do you keep humoring her?
-She's fun.
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>You know, if we were still married,
this would probably be enough
to spiral us off into a big argument,
that isn't even about the waitress,
and we would fight all night.
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>But since we're not married,
I can just be like, whatever.
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>-This is truly great.
-So... great.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>We are doing so great.
</p><timestamp>00:08:26</timestamp>
<p>Although...
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>I do get lonely sometimes
in that big house all by myself.
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>Hey, why don't you have
a housewarming party?
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>-Eh...
-Yeah!
</p><timestamp>00:08:36</timestamp>
<p>Now that you don't have a mean wife
who hates parties...
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>He-he, you can finally live it up.
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>Okay, but only if you come.
Promise?
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>I'll come if you have
those divorce papers.
</p><timestamp>00:08:46</timestamp>
<p>-Aah!
-Me again.
</p><timestamp>00:08:46</timestamp>
<p>What did you order?
I didn't write it down.
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>

I saw everything.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I'm fine.
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>I can't pick sides in this divorce
because I'm good friends
with the both of you,
but I want you to know, no matter what,
I'm here for you and also there for him.
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>And if you ever need anything,
just let me know
and I'll be your rock,
as long as it doesn't conflict with me
also being Mr. Peanutbutter's rock,
or my work,
which is keeping me very busy.
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me, I have to take this.

<p>Hi, Flip? Yeah, are we sure
we need this strip club set?

we cannot get that money back.

<p>I'm so sorry to bother you,

the movie you were filming,
what happens at the end?

<p>You get divorced, you go to Vietnam

</p><timestamp>00:22:45</timestamp>
<p>How does it work out?
</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>

that this whole thing
goes all the way to the top.
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>So me and my clone have to team up
and head to Dubai.

<p>A lot of it is setting up the franchise.
You know how it is.

<p>-Um... it's an action movie?
