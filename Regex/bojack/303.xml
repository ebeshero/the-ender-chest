<p>What happened to my birthday cake?
</p><timestamp>00:00:11</timestamp>
<p>- Goober.
- It wasn't me.
</p><timestamp>00:00:13</timestamp>
<p>But you're welcome to check my pockets.
</p><timestamp>00:00:16</timestamp>
<p>- Go home, Goober.

</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>I'm now the proprietor/spokesperson/
number one customer of Whale World.
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>At Whale World, families come together
to admire the fine female form
of the majestic killer whale.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>It's educational.
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p><i>Join us in the Splash Zone.</i>

<p><i>Whoo-hoo!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p><i>These orcas have the floppiest</i>

<p><i>and they can't wait to jump</i>

</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>Bring your prepubescent daughters,
who are beginning to be cognizant
of a woman's role in the world.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>They won't internalize
deeply problematic notions
about the commodification
of sexuality in today's society.
</p><timestamp>00:01:02</timestamp>
<p>What are you talking about?
It's just whales.
</p><timestamp>00:01:05</timestamp>
<p>And what about so-called "experts,"
who say it's wrong
to keep these girls in captivity
so they can amuse and entertain us?
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>Well, to those people I say,
"Stop saying that, okay?"
</p><timestamp>00:01:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}These sea girls are my family,
and my business.
</p><timestamp>00:01:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And they can be yours too.
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Come on down to Whale World,
a fun, sexy time for the whole family.

<p>- Hey, Jill.

</p><timestamp>00:02:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}An elementary school all inclusive
non-denominational winter day pageant.
</p><timestamp>00:02:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, no. The snow goblin wants to destroy
our seasonal festivities.
</p><timestamp>00:02:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"Snow goblin" is an offensive slur.
</p><timestamp>00:02:49</timestamp>
<p>Jesus, Jill.
And you thought your play sucked.
</p><timestamp>00:02:51</timestamp>
<p>- I didn't.
- <i>Well, regardless.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A lot of these fancy kids'
fancy parents are Oscar voters.
</p><timestamp>00:02:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}If I wanna get nominated,
I got to rub elbows
</p><timestamp>00:02:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and whatever the non-denominational

</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>Hobnob. Did you check
on Cuddlywhiskers like I asked?
</p><timestamp>00:03:03</timestamp>
<p>He's doing great.
Little of this, little of that.
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p>Likes to go jogging... in a big wheel.
</p><timestamp>00:03:09</timestamp>
<p>- You didn't check on him, did you?
- Completely forgot.
</p><timestamp>00:03:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- Shh! Keep it down, buddy.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Did you miss the three wise people make
their journey to visit the regular baby?
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>Go to his house.
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>If he's not there, you must retrieve
something for me,
something of a sensitive nature.
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, fine, if it'll finally make you stop
calling me, asking me to go on errands.
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>- What do you need?
- A letter I wrote him,
back when we were, prepare yourself,
I'm about to say lovers... Lovers.
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- That was not enough time to prepare.
- Get off the phone, jerk.
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p>It was years ago
and it was quite beautiful
and disgusting all at once.
I remember it fondly. And horribly.
</p><timestamp>00:03:42</timestamp>
<p>- What's in the letter?
- None of your concern. I must have it,
for... sentimental reasons. Goodbye.
</p><timestamp>00:03:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- Did you have a nice phone call?
- Are you in the Academy?
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- No.
- Then I don't care what you think.
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- I got to go do a thing for someone.
- Fine.
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You made your appearance,
you were magnificent, I'm very proud.
</p><timestamp>00:03:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But don't forget, you have a full day
of muckety-muck glad-handing.
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The Bat Mitzvah,

</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You'll be wonderful,
I have complete faith in you.
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That is literally the first time
anyone ever said that to me.
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Diane, you'll keep up
his Internet presence?
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I want him trending by this afternoon.
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But good trending, not bad trending,
you understand?
</p><timestamp>00:04:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hashtag you betcha.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Did I just say hashtag out loud?
Hashtag, oops. Hashtag, oh no!
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>I'm honestly more alarmed
by the "you betcha".
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>I'll take a smoke break
before these little boogers
dig into the refrain
of "Frosty the Non-Gendered Snow Person."

<p>Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>Hello, my precious darling
slice of sunshine,
who I am <i>not </i>putting on a pedestal.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>Just calling for our daily download,
as per Dr. Janet's
friendly but firm suggestion.
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>When do you think you'll be home?
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>- Uh, it might be late.
- Okay, just let me know.
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>I cherish you, I respect you
and you have value.
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>I feel valued and I value you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>I am hearing that and I accept that.
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>- Diane?
- Yes?
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p><i>Do you accept my acceptance?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>I hear it and I accept it and I value it

</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>Promise you won't work too hard today?
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>I won't, if you promise me
you won't bother that skunk next door.
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to come home
to a stinky husband.
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>That is some great food for thought.
I gotta go right now.

<p>Mr. Peanutbutter,
my favorite weekday client.
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>- Why are you calling on the weekend?
- I need your help.
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>I've done something bad, very bad.
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>Put the corpse on ice, I'm on my way.
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p>What? No, it's not. Why would I--
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>Listen, I was sniffing around
where I didn't belong and I got skunked.
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>- What?
<i>- You got to help us.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>- Us?
- Todd's here too.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>I'm skunked, Princess Carolyn.
Skunked real bad.
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we got real bad skunked,
super skunked.
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>- Hardcore.
- Yeah, hardcore skunked.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>Okay. First things first,
don't go back in the house.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>Sadly, you can call me L.L. Cool J
because I am in the house.
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>Yecch! Okay, don't move.
I'll be there in 20.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>Mind if I do this real quick?
I gotta pick up a letter.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>Can we make the appearances
we're supposed to make and go home?
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p>Oh, sure.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>I haven't seen you much
since you moved out of my deck chairs.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>You know, I've been focusing
on my new job and my marriage and--
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>- And avoiding me?
- I'm not avoiding you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>I'm just making an effort
to not be in a room alone with you
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>- because I am... avoiding you.
- Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>You know, I think we're alike
in a lot of ways.
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>
<p>I always tell people
you're like the not-cool version of me.
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>Sometimes that's great,
but it also means we can bring out
the worst in each other.
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>I'm trying to get my life back on track.
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>I just think maybe it's better,
for both of us,
if we keep things
a little more professional.
</p><timestamp>00:06:57</timestamp>
<p>Yes, okay. Professional.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>BoJack and Diane being professional.
Doing our jobs and nothing else.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>We're at the place I needed to go to.
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>It's so weird I drove here on accident.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>Might as well run in
and grab that thing I need to get.
</p><timestamp>00:07:09</timestamp>
<p>- Then, back to business.

</p><timestamp>00:07:13</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>creaking</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>- It's spooky in here. Too spooky.
- Really?
</p><timestamp>00:07:21</timestamp>
<p>And what would be the right amount
of spooky? Jesus, this thing's heavy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>Now I know how Hilary Swank's arms
got so jacked.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>Put it down, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>Does it look weird?
Me with an Oscar?
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>- I actually think that it feels--
- Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p>- I think she's dead.
- Hold on, maybe she's not dead.
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>Maybe she's just being a-- a whale?
No, she's dead.
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>Maybe there's someone
in her phone we can call.
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>Diane, kids these days don't call.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>They communicate
via a combination of text messages,
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>- eye rolls, and dick pics.
- Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:07:49</timestamp>
<p>What is it? Dick pics?
See if they spell out a message.
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>guns cocking</subtitle>
- Freeze! Drop the Oscar!
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>- Oh, man.
- Well, well, well.
</p><timestamp>00:07:57</timestamp>
<p>Or should I say whale, whale, whale?
Killer whale, that is.
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p>Or should I say <i>killed</i> whale?
</p><timestamp>00:08:03</timestamp>
<p>- Listen, Officer--
- I told you to freeze.
</p><timestamp>00:08:05</timestamp>
<p>You just became prime suspects
in the case I like to call,
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>"Black and White and Dead All Over,
A Whale Of A Crime:
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>An Officer Meow Meow Fuzzyface Mystery."
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>Eh...
</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>- Cuff 'em, boys, or, uh, girls.
- I am a woman, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:08:22</timestamp>
<p>Lindsay, you know I am trying.
</p><timestamp>00:08:24</timestamp>
<p>Can we please show a united front
in front of the perps?
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>- We will talk about this later.
- Aww.
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>Ohh! It smells like a skunk
skunked another skunk in here,
then they smoked a joint.
What happened?
</p><timestamp>00:08:36</timestamp>
<p>First I rolled all over the couch
to get the skunk stench out,
but that did not work.
</p><timestamp>00:08:41</timestamp>
<p>Then I ran into every room to rub myself
on all my clothes and belongings,
to get the Mr. Peanutbutter smell back.
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>And then I smoked a joint,
so that might be
why it smells like skunk in here.
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn, I have to fix this
before Diane gets home.
</p><timestamp>00:08:55</timestamp>
<p>Things have been shaky with us
since she pretended
to be out of the country for two months.
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>And then when I filled our entire house
with these giant crates
of spaghetti strainers, that did not help.
</p><timestamp>00:09:03</timestamp>
<p>Why buy these spaghetti strainers
in the first place?
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I don't even remember.
I'm sure it'll pay off at some point.
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>Man, married life is weird.
</p><timestamp>00:09:11</timestamp>
<p>We're making an effort
and getting stronger every day,
but I swear to God we are like five
big fights away from a divorce,
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>I do not want this to be one.
</p><timestamp>00:09:19</timestamp>
<p>Okay, number first.
We got to get you in a tomato bath.
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>Mmm! Delicious and nutritious.
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>Is marinara all right,
or will I need something zestier
like Arrabiata?
</p><timestamp>00:09:27</timestamp>
<p>Tomato bath.
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:09:31</timestamp>
<p>I am so high right now. <subtitle>sniffs</subtitle>
Wait, was there a skunk in here?
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Princess Carolyn groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>- What do you know about Nadia?
- Uh, who's Nadia?
</p><timestamp>00:09:43</timestamp>
<p>Your friend doing the face-down mambo
in the king-sized bathtub.
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>- Now I know her name is Nadia.
- Oh, so you're a comedian, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p>Although I am trying to branch
into more serious roles.
</p><timestamp>00:09:53</timestamp>
<p>You pigs think you can march all over us.
But I know my rights.
</p><timestamp>00:09:56</timestamp>
<p>- Yeah, what are they?
- I mean, I don't <i>know them</i> know them.
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>But I know that I have them.
So, can I check my phone real quick?
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>You're not gonna look up your rights,
are you?
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>What? No.
</p><timestamp>00:10:07</timestamp>
<p>I'm just supposed to moderate
an Emily VanCamp live-chat talkback
on Snapchat.
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>Let me just set up
the user preferences here, and...
you can't detain us
unless we're under arrest.
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>Damn it. You <i>were </i>looking up
your rights, weren't you?
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>Nope, that was just a thing
I already knew.
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>Everyone's stupid rights these days.
I never get to have any fun.
</p><timestamp>00:10:29</timestamp>
<p>- Let's get out of here.
- BoJack, I need to show you something.
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>
<p>This is Nadia's phone.
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>I did not know you were such a klepto.
I can buy you a new phone.
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>Check this out,
the last text message she sent.
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p>"BoJack is going to kill me?"
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>I think someone's trying to frame you,
for murder.

</p><timestamp>00:10:48</timestamp>
<p>We got to get to Brentwood.
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>At this time of day?
It's gonna be... murder.

<p>We need to figure out who's behind this.
Call Jill, find out what she knows.
</p><timestamp>00:11:20</timestamp>
<p>Good thinking.
</p><timestamp>00:11:21</timestamp>
<p>If I go to jail, that will throw

</p><timestamp>00:11:25</timestamp>
<p>The Academy does not look kindly
on murder.
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>Rape, they don't seem

</p><timestamp>00:11:28</timestamp>
<p>Be careful. Jill could be the one

<p>What am I supposed to tweet?
"Someone got murdered, we found the body.

<p>Buy me a private dance
in the Blowhole Room.
</p><timestamp>00:15:10</timestamp>
<p>- Oh, please.
- Ugh, gross. Private dance?
</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>
<p>But if that's the only way she'll talk,
then fine.
</p><timestamp>00:15:16</timestamp>
<p>Fine, I'm offended. Yuck.
</p><timestamp>00:15:17</timestamp>

<p>Oh, um, you can dance however

<p>Tango, waltz, salsa.
I'm just saying, but pretend I'm not here.
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p>- How would you dance then?
- Like a stripper, probably.
</p><timestamp>00:15:35</timestamp>
<p>Listen, we have some bad news.
Your friend Nadia is dead.
</p><timestamp>00:15:40</timestamp>
<p>- Not surprised.
- You're not?
</p><timestamp>00:15:42</timestamp>
<p>A lot of girls like her come through here.
Sweet, vulnerable.
</p><timestamp>00:15:45</timestamp>

<p>But once your body gets too banged up,
they don't want you no more.

<p>Doesn't ring a bell, never met the guy.

<p>His house has been abandoned

<p>He had some sort of system.
Told 'em he was gonna help 'em.
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>- What do you mean, "system"?
- I have already said too much.
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>A system is a formulated method
or plan of procedure.
</p><timestamp>00:16:23</timestamp>
<p>- I know what the word "system" means--

"BoJack is going to kill me."

<p>Sorry about what I said.

when I was staying with you.
</p><timestamp>00:17:26</timestamp>
<p>I'm trying not to be that person.
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>I make you unhappy?
Is that what you're saying?
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>It's not about being happy.
That's the thing.
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm just trying to get through each day.
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>I can't keep asking myself, "Am I happy?"
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>It just makes me more miserable.
</p><timestamp>00:17:39</timestamp>
<p>Can I get a photo with the star?
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>- Of course.

<p>I don't know if I believe in it,
real lasting happiness.

<p>All those perky, well-adjusted people
you see in movies and TV shows?

<p>- I don't think they exist.
- No one's happy all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:17:56</timestamp>
<p>- You have to focus on the small things.
- Right.
</p><timestamp>00:17:59</timestamp>
<p>- Like winning an Oscar.

</p><timestamp>00:18:01</timestamp>
<p>Hey, old pal.

</p><timestamp>00:18:04</timestamp>
<p>Hope your voting finger works.

</p><timestamp>00:20:37</timestamp>
<p>You made me the face of this drug,
because to you my face is a symbol
for the opiate of show business.
</p><timestamp>00:20:43</timestamp>
<p>- No, man. You played The Horse.
- Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>- Horse is a nickname for heroin.
- What?
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>- BoJack. Horse. Heroin.
- Uh-huh. Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>Oh-- Oh, okay. Yeah, right.
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>
<p>- Police!
- Oh, God, not again.
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>Gotcha!
Richie Osborne, you're under arrest.
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>- Oh, right, Reggie.
- Richie.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>- That's what I said. I said Rickie.
- <subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>Thank God. How did you find us?
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>Your Twitter account is hooked up
to your phone's location services.
</p><timestamp>00:21:07</timestamp>
<p>We've been tracking you
through your tweets all night.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>Actually, I've been tracking you
all night.
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>Lindsay, I said "we".
Do you need credit for everything?
</p><timestamp>00:21:15</timestamp>
<p>- I would like credit for something.
- <subtitle>sarcastic yowl</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>What do we know?
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>Nadia was not murdered.
She died of a heroin overdose.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>No one tried to frame me.
All right, back in the Oscar race.
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p>Look out, Jurj Clooners.
</p><timestamp>00:21:27</timestamp>
<p>But something's still fishy
about this whole mess,
</p><timestamp>00:21:29</timestamp>
<p>- and it's not just the killer whales.
- Whales are mammals, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>- I said it's <i>not</i> the whales.
- You said it's not <i>just</i> the whales.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>There's more to this story.
What are we missing?
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>Cuddlywhiskers. What was Nadia
doing in his backyard in the first place?
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p>What was this "system"?
And where is he now?
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>Why was it so important to Jill
to get that letter back?
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah, the letter.
This mystery has too many things.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>I say we go back to the house and
finally get to the bottom of what's what.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>Oh, this is turning into a real caper.
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>A real Jill Pill jail fail
killer whale caper.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> You're doing 50 in a 35.
<subtitle>Diane</subtitle> Oh, God, you're right.
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p>I feel so alive.
</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle> This letter is really graphic.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>It's all about their magical nights
up at the Ojai property.
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>Ojai property?
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>She wrote out the sounds.
What is a "sploink"?
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>Did you know Cuddlywhiskers
had an Ojai property?
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>Sure. He always loved
to disappear up there.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>After our show got canceled,
he went there for six months.
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>It's funny, at the time no one knew
where he was and we got really worried.
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, wonder where he went this time.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you know what?
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>- I don't see him. Do you?
- Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>- <i>I'm Terry Gross and this your ring tone.</i>
- Shit.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>- Diane, where the hell are you?
- Ojai.
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>Oh, hi? You've been gone all night,
all you have to say is "Oh, hi?"
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>I'm so sorry. BoJack and I
were trying to find a killer and--
</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you're with BoJack still?
Well, that explains it. Of course.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter,
I understand and affirm your feeling--
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>I'm glad you're safe.
I was worried about you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p>- What I'm hearing you say is you were--
- No, stop.
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>You have to call me.
It doesn't matter what's happening,
doesn't matter
if it's the middle of the night.
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>You can't keep doing this to me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm coming home.
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm going back to bed.
We'll talk about this in the morning.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p>- Everything okay?
- No.
</p><timestamp>00:23:13</timestamp>
<p>- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>It's my fault.
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
- BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>Mmm.
</p><timestamp>00:23:26</timestamp>
<p>After <i>The BoJack Horseman Show</i>
fell apart, I got depressed a long time.
</p><timestamp>00:23:30</timestamp>
<p>Sure, I wrote a bunch of hit movies,
I made a ton of money,
but it wasn't fulfilling.
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>I remember when I won my Oscar,
standing up on that stage,
looking at the statue and thought,
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>"This is supposed to be
the happiest moment of my life."
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>And I never felt more miserable.
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p>- Oh. Because you're sober?
- Because an Oscar is meaningless.
</p><timestamp>00:23:46</timestamp>
<p>It's all meaningless.
I dedicated myself to helping others.
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>I turned my home into a halfway house
for troubled addicts.
</p><timestamp>00:23:52</timestamp>
<p>I had this system for recovery,
and it helped a lot of them,
but even more slipped through the cracks.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>That, too, left me empty.
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>Everyone was worried about you,
you know.
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>You can't just disappear.
You really hurt a lot of people.
</p><timestamp>00:24:05</timestamp>
<p>Sometimes you need to take responsibility
for your own happiness.
</p><timestamp>00:24:08</timestamp>
<p>You don't think that's a little selfish?
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p>I don't know what to tell you.
I'm happy, for the first time in my life.
</p><timestamp>00:24:14</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna feel bad about it.
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>It takes a long time to realize
how truly miserable you are,
even longer to see
it doesn't have to be that way.
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p>Only after you give up everything
can you begin to find a way to be happy.
</p><timestamp>00:24:35</timestamp>
<p>Can you believe that guy?
What a nut, right?
</p><timestamp>00:24:39</timestamp>
<p>I just wanna go home.
