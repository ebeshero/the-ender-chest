<p><subtitle>Mr. Peanutbutter</subtitle>
So, did you have a good birthday?
</p><timestamp>00:00:11</timestamp>
<p>-It was an amazing birthday!
-I had a great day, too.
</p><timestamp>00:00:14</timestamp>
<p>I wish every day could be like this.
Just the two of us, together.
</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p>Yeah? You weren't too bored
by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth"?
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>Are you kidding?
</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>I loved "Women on the Wall: An
Exploration of Gender in Text and Media,
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth."
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>It combined my two favorite things:
modern art
and people talking about modern art.
</p><timestamp>00:00:37</timestamp>
<p>I loved everything about today.
Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:40</timestamp>
<p>-So, there's nothing else you want?
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:00:42</timestamp>
<p>All I want is to get into bed,
listen to <i>Prairie Home Companion</i>
and snuggle up
to my wonderful husband.
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p>-You don't want anything else?
-No. Today was perfect.
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>-Any additional thing would be overkill.
-Okay. If you say so.
</p><timestamp>00:00:59</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all</subtitle> Surprise!
-Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:01:02</timestamp>
<p>Are you surprised?
Tell me you're surprised.
</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:01:05</timestamp>
<p>She's speechless.
Oh, we got her good, folks.
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p>Now let's party!
</p><timestamp>00:01:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>♪♪</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:07</timestamp>
<p>He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?
</p><timestamp>00:02:11</timestamp>
<p>He is dead, goddamn it!
</p><timestamp>00:02:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:02:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Hey, we should go.
-No, don't leave.
</p><timestamp>00:02:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}There's so much party left.
</p><timestamp>00:02:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Paul McCartney's
gonna jump out of a cake.
</p><timestamp>00:02:23</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, Wanda and I have to get
to a prior engagement--
</p><timestamp>00:02:25</timestamp>
<p>-Party.
-A prior engagement party.
</p><timestamp>00:02:27</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior,
and it's a party for his engagement.
</p><timestamp>00:02:31</timestamp>
<p>Engagement,
so it's a Prior engagement party.
</p><timestamp>00:02:33</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-And we gotta get there early
</p><timestamp>00:02:35</timestamp>
<p>-because of the. Si...
-The si... Silent auction!
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>-Auction, yeah.
-<subtitle>Peanutbutter</subtitle> Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:02:40</timestamp>
<p>To benefit Berto Eco's fight
against heart disease...
</p><timestamp>00:02:43</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-Wareness.
</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>His fight
against heart disease awareness.
</p><timestamp>00:02:47</timestamp>
<p>-Gotta go.
-Wait, BoJack!
</p><timestamp>00:02:49</timestamp>
<p>-No! You're my ride.
-Too late, Todd. Save yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:02:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I'll take you home.
-Come on, stick around a little.
</p><timestamp>00:02:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had
a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.
</p><timestamp>00:02:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Come on, Todd, get in the car.
-<subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:03:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I give them three months.
-Well, what makes you say that?
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Let me think about,
what was my first clue?
</p><timestamp>00:03:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ah! Remember that time
at Diane's birthday party
</p><timestamp>00:03:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}when they got
in that huge screaming match
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}over whether or not
Tony Curtis was dead?
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-That was weird.
-I don't wanna start another fight,
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-but is he dead?
-If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.
</p><timestamp>00:03:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The man's a national treasure.
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}He's the one speck of romance
in this tainted cynical world.
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I'll say. His cereal is great! Look out!
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>both shouting</subtitle>
-<subtitle>tires squeal</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:34</timestamp>
<p>Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>-Vincent?
-Ooh.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>-That kid looks just like my boyfriend.
-Does he?
</p><timestamp>00:03:40</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Carolyn</subtitle>
I'd know that face anywhere.
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, hey, people look
like people all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A lot of folks say
that I look like Octavia Spencer
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy
from the Guten Bourbon ads.
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}How could I have been so stupid?
This is why he never invited me
</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}to his house,
why I've never met any of his friends.
</p><timestamp>00:03:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What are you saying?
-Vincent has a secret family.
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That kid was his son.
The lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool!
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Uh... where are we going?
-I need a drink.
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p>-Are you gonna take me home first?
-You better call me back, asshole.
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>I don't even know
who you are anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>It's like you're three different people.
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>
<p>-So, you're not gonna take me home first?
-Should I call him again?
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure there's a simple explanation.
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat
all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>It's because he's so sneaky.

</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, that's him!
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>Quick, jump out the window, shimmy
down the drainpipe and wait in the car.
</p><timestamp>00:04:35</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Vincent has a terrible temper.
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>He throws tantrums.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>If he finds you in my apartment,
who knows what he's capable of?
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>But, also, stay close,
because if he finds me alone,
who knows
what he's capable of?
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>-Looking young.
-<subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Aah!
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>-Hi.
-Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>My name's Kevin. I promise you,
there is an explanation for all this.
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Where's your daddy?
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>He's, uh, looking for parking.
He'll be up in a minute.
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p>-I have to pee.
-Okay, the bathroom is just back there.
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>Ah. Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>Oh, nope.

</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p>How many ounces are in a barrel?
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p><i>A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm out of questions.
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>Do you have any questions for me?
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p><i>I do have a question, Todd.</i>

</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>Um...
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>Hi.
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>Well, well, well,
look what the me dragged in.
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>Is it dragged or drug?
Either way, drop dead.
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn, listen.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>And Kevin is in the bathroom
and I'm standing right here,
so as you can see
we're clearly two different people:
one adult and one child.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, bye!
-Not so fast, cowboy.
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>-I'm a man-man.
-Why didn't you tell me any of this?
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>I thought if you knew I had a kid
you wouldn't want to be with me
because kids always make a racket
when mommies are trying to do
their homework for night school.
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>I don't know what to make of this.
Are there other secrets I don't know?
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>Uh, nope.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>Should you check on Kevin?
He's been in the bathroom for a long time.
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah. Kevin.
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>And when you don't regret
the tattoo in the morning,
that's how you know it's love.

-Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>When he heard me peeing,
it made him have to pee.
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>-So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>Weird, I still haven't seen
the two of you together.
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>Uh, could you get me a glass of water?
All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

<p>-Oh, you're back.
-Yep. We're both here.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>-Can I get you a drink?
-Okay, not talking, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>See, this is part of the problem.
We don't communicate.
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>Do you really think now is the best time
to read the paper?
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>-Vincent?!
-Uh, could I have a chocolate, please?
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>Sure, sweetheart.

<p>Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?
</p><timestamp>00:08:05</timestamp>
<p>-Now where did he go?
-He was getting on my nerves.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>-Children.
-Well, I got this snack for him.
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>Right, uh, could you turn around
for a second?
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>-What? Why?
-Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>Because you have such a pretty figure.
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.

<p>Can you take that towel off your head?
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>And what happened to my bowling ball?
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p>My dad spilled some wine on his face,
so he's using the towel to clean up.
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p>And I threw your bowling ball
out the window.
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>-What?!

<p>-I gave Kevin the chocolate.

</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>Well, he ate the chocolate

so I got the chocolate on my face.

<p>You know, when we first met,
I was looking for something in my life.

<p>And I wanted it so badly
that I made myself believe you were it.
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>But I think that wanting
to believe something
isn't the same
as something being real.
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>And this isn't real.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>What are you saying?
</p><timestamp>00:09:56</timestamp>
<p>I think it's time we stop pretending.

-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:10:09</timestamp>
<p>-Did you guys work it out?
-We broke up.
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:10:17</timestamp>
<p>I guess I was just foolish enough
to believe this dumb world
still had a little spark
of romance in it.
</p><timestamp>00:10:22</timestamp>
<p>-Well, you can still believe that.
-No, I gotta stop kidding myself.
</p><timestamp>00:10:26</timestamp>
<p>Tony Curtis is dead.
</p><timestamp>00:10:31</timestamp>
<p>He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?
</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>He is dead, goddamn it!
</p><timestamp>00:10:38</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:10:40</timestamp>
<p>Hey, we should go.
</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>
<p>Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter really
baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake?
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>No, I don't think you bake
Paul McCartney into the cake.
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>You bake the cake first
and then McCartney gets inside.
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>I feel really bad
about causing that fight,
but I honestly didn't know
if Tony Curtis was alive or not.
</p><timestamp>00:11:00</timestamp>
<p>So many people died while I was
in the coma, I'm getting up to speed.
</p><timestamp>00:11:03</timestamp>
<p>Finding out Sinatra was dead
was a real curveball.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>Ditto, most of my family.
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>Look, what happened back there
is not your fault.
</p><timestamp>00:11:10</timestamp>
<p>That's just what happens
when two people live together.
</p><timestamp>00:11:13</timestamp>
<p>That's a weird thing to say to your
girlfriend who just moved in with you.
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>-Do you think maybe we're going too fast?
-Oh, I get it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:21</timestamp>
<p>So your friends got in a big fight and
that means we have to get in a big fight.
</p><timestamp>00:11:25</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to get in a fight.
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p>We moved in together
without much thought.
</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, it was your idea.
And it's been great.
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>Sure, it's great now.
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>But it could be not great later
and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend
if I didn't prematurely freak out
about that. I mean, what is this?
</p><timestamp>00:11:39</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. It's been two weeks.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>Let's give ourselves some time
before we rush to judgment.
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>-Can I tell you a joke?
-Uh, sure.
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, so there's this gardener, right?
-Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>-Would you just listen?
-Okay, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>So, the amazing thing
about this gardener
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p><i>is that he always knows</i>
<i>exactly how many bags of mulch</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:00</timestamp>
<p><i>he needs for a job, just by looking.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p><i>Like, he gets it right every time.</i>
<i>He's the best.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p><i>So, one day he looks at a yard</i>
<i>he's working on,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p><i>and he's like, "18 bags."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p><i>So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags</i>
<i>of mulch and goes to work.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p><i>And when he's finished,</i>
<i>the flower beds are amazing.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p><i>-Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies--</i>
-<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> <i>Orchid bushes?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Wanda</subtitle> <i>You wouldn't have</i>
<i>a bush of orchids.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:21</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle>
<i>You said this gardener was the best.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Wanda</subtitle> <i>Okay, fine, all right,</i>
<i>beautiful orchid bushes.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.
</p><timestamp>00:12:30</timestamp>
<p><i>He can't believe it.</i>
<i>This has never happened before.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p><i>Well, the extra bag of mulch</i>
<i>drives him crazy.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p><i>He's the guy who always gets</i>
<i>the right amount of mulch.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p><i>He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p><i>So, on the drive home,</i>
<i>he throws the bag of mulch</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p><i>out the window</i>
<i>over the side of the 101.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>-And?
-Well, that's it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>-He throws it out the window.
-That's the punch line?
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p>-It's kind of a thinker.
-I'll say.
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>Makes me think you forgot
the rest of the joke.
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p>No, no, oh, just picture it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>He's on the 101,
and he throws the bag of mulch
out over the side of the freeway.
</p><timestamp>00:13:03</timestamp>
<p>I got the narrative.
That wasn't the source of my confusion.
</p><timestamp>00:13:06</timestamp>
<p>The confusion was
about the joke not being funny.
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>
<p>Why does everything have to be funny?
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>Everything doesn't always have
to be funny. Just jokes.
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>Well, everyone at the network loves it.
Ha, ha.
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, I just thought about it again.
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>-Ha! Mulch.
-Listen, Wanda.
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>I think maybe there's some things
we kind of glossed over
as we rushed into this relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>We don't know each other at all.
</p><timestamp>00:13:27</timestamp>
<p>-Maybe we should take a step back and--
-BoJack, watch out!
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>both</subtitle> Aah!
-Oh, no!
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>-What was that?
-A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?
</p><timestamp>00:13:37</timestamp>
<p>I heard someone scream, "Oh, no."
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes
when you hit it with your car.
</p><timestamp>00:13:43</timestamp>
<p>Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>Hey, what are you doing here in
the middle of the road? Are you crazy?
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groaning and grunting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, we just hit a deer.
We have to get him to a hospital.
</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>He's fine. He's in the woods.
</p><timestamp>00:13:57</timestamp>
<p>You know, you hit a deer
and they limp off to the woods to...
continue living their lives.
What are you doing?
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>I'm going to find him
and I'm going to help him.
</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p>If you wanna go for a walk
in the woods at night, go crazy,
but I'm not going anywhere.
</p><timestamp>00:14:11</timestamp>
<p>Okay, knock yourself out.
</p><timestamp>00:14:13</timestamp>
<p>I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.

<p>-Wanna hear another joke?
-Well, is it a joke or is it a story?
</p><timestamp>00:16:09</timestamp>
<p>I'll listen to another story,
if you stop calling them jokes.
</p><timestamp>00:16:12</timestamp>
<p>So, there's this couple who just started
dating and things are going really well.
</p><timestamp>00:16:16</timestamp>
<p>One day, the girl finds a box of old love
letters from her high school boyfriend.
</p><timestamp>00:16:20</timestamp>
<p><i>She reads them and, like,</i>
<i>loves how silly they are.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:23</timestamp>
<p><i>You know,</i>
<i>the drama of young romance.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:25</timestamp>
<p><i>So, on a whim, she sends the letters</i>
<i>to her ex-boyfriend</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:28</timestamp>
<p><i>thinking he might find them funny too.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p><i>Well, okay, that night,</i>
<i>she tells her current boyfriend about it</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p><i>and he loses his shit.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:35</timestamp>
<p><i>They get in a huge fight about it.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:37</timestamp>
<p><i>He's all, "Why would you send</i>
<i>your ex the old love letters?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:40</timestamp>
<p><i>He'll think</i>
<i>you're still in love with him!"</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>
<p><i>And she's just like, "Relax, Brandon!"</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:45</timestamp>
<p>-Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?
-Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.
</p><timestamp>00:16:49</timestamp>
<p>I forgot to mention that.
It doesn't matter.
</p><timestamp>00:16:51</timestamp>
<p><i>So, anyway, now the night is ruined</i>
<i>because Brandon is obsessed.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:55</timestamp>
<p><i>He's like, "That ex-boyfriend's</i>
<i>going to come back for you.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p><i>He knows where you live!"</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:59</timestamp>
<p><i>So, after dinner, he drives her home.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:01</timestamp>
<p><i>She lives in one of those big buildings</i>
<i>by the freeway.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:04</timestamp>
<p><i>And he walks her to her door,</i>
but he forgets to lock the car
and leaves the windows down.
</p><timestamp>00:17:10</timestamp>
<p>He kisses her good night,
but things are kind of weird, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:17:14</timestamp>
<p>Then he gets back in his car
and starts to drive away,
</p><timestamp>00:17:17</timestamp>
<p><i>but when he glances</i>
<i>in his rear-view mirror,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:19</timestamp>
<p><i>his blood turns cold.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:22</timestamp>
<p>Guess what's in the back seat.
</p><timestamp>00:17:24</timestamp>
<p>-The ex-boyfriend?
-No. The bag of mulch!
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>What? Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>Wow, that is actually
a really good joke.
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>I told you. Some things take time.
</p><timestamp>00:17:39</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Carolyn</subtitle> I'll take you home.
</p><timestamp>00:17:41</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, come on, stick around a little.
-Nope. I gotta take Todd home.
</p><timestamp>00:17:44</timestamp>
<p>Had a wonderful time.
Really. It just flew by.
</p><timestamp>00:17:46</timestamp>
<p>-Come on, Todd, get in the car.
-<subtitle>Todd</subtitle> Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:17:49</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>mumbling</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:53</timestamp>
<p>Um, do you wanna talk
about what happened?
</p><timestamp>00:17:56</timestamp>
<p>What happened? No, I don't wanna talk
about what happened,
</p><timestamp>00:17:59</timestamp>
<p>-I just wanna clean up.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:18:01</timestamp>
<p>-Why? What do you think happened?
-I just--
</p><timestamp>00:18:04</timestamp>
<p>Because what I think happened
is that BoJack's girlfriend asked
what Tony Curtis was up to
and I said, "Tony Curtis died."
</p><timestamp>00:18:10</timestamp>
<p>-And you said, "Did he?"
-Right, but---
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p>And I said, "Yes, he did."
And you said, "Really?
</p><timestamp>00:18:15</timestamp>
<p>-I'm not sure about that."
-Yeah--
</p><timestamp>00:18:16</timestamp>
<p>And I said, "Well, I am."
And you said, "I'm not so sure."
</p><timestamp>00:18:20</timestamp>
<p>And I said, "I'm telling you,
Tony Curtis is dead."
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p>And you said,
"Let's check the Internet."
</p><timestamp>00:18:24</timestamp>
<p>And I said, "We don't need to check
the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."
</p><timestamp>00:18:27</timestamp>
<p>And you said, "Let's just check though."
</p><timestamp>00:18:30</timestamp>
<p>Is that what you think happened?
</p><timestamp>00:18:33</timestamp>
<p>So, do you wanna talk about it?
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>It kind of feels
like you wanna talk about it.
</p><timestamp>00:18:37</timestamp>
<p>I don't understand why you couldn't
just believe that I know something.
</p><timestamp>00:18:40</timestamp>
<p>I believe you know lots of things.
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>I just thought,
what's the harm in checking?
</p><timestamp>00:18:44</timestamp>
<p>Especially since we have
these amazing little boxes now
with 24-hour access to the world's
largest source of information.
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>You shouldn't have to check if your wife
knows what she's talking about.
</p><timestamp>00:18:54</timestamp>
<p>You humiliated me
in front of all my friends.
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>
<p>You can give it a rest. Show's over.
</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>Okay, but don't I get
a little bit of credit
for inviting all of your friends
to an awesome surprise party?
</p><timestamp>00:19:05</timestamp>
<p>No, because why did you think I would
want an awesome surprise party?
</p><timestamp>00:19:09</timestamp>
<p>Is it the awesome part
you object to or...?
</p><timestamp>00:19:12</timestamp>
<p>You always just assume
that everyone wants whatever you want.
</p><timestamp>00:19:15</timestamp>
<p>Well, you know
what they say about assuming.
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>
<p>Makes an ass out of you and "ming."
</p><timestamp>00:19:20</timestamp>
<p>Who's Ming?
</p><timestamp>00:19:21</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, Diane. Okay?
I'm sorry I threw you a party.
</p><timestamp>00:19:27</timestamp>
<p>What a monster.
</p><timestamp>00:19:29</timestamp>
<p>Throwing you a party
like some sort of terrorist.
</p><timestamp>00:19:32</timestamp>
<p>It's a well-known fact
that if you really hate someone,
really wanna hit them where it hurts,
throw them a party.
</p><timestamp>00:19:37</timestamp>
<p>That's why when we go to war,
we don't drop bombs on the enemy.
</p><timestamp>00:19:40</timestamp>
<p>We drop parties! So, I'm <i>so</i> sorry
I threw you an amazing party.
</p><timestamp>00:19:46</timestamp>
<p>You didn't throw me an amazing party.
You threw <i>you</i> an amazing party.
</p><timestamp>00:19:50</timestamp>
<p>Everything today has been about you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:51</timestamp>
<p>Really? That picnic we had
in the tea garden was about me?
</p><timestamp>00:19:55</timestamp>
<p>That trip to the library was about me?

<p>"Women on the Wall: An Exploration

<p>Oh. So now you're gonna play in the

</p><timestamp>00:20:15</timestamp>
<p>Why does my birthday party
have a ball pit?
</p><timestamp>00:20:18</timestamp>
<p>-So I could get these T-shirts made.
-Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:20:22</timestamp>
<p>Also, you once told me
that when you were a little girl,
you dreamed of living in a house
that had a ballroom.
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>-A ballroom is not a room full-- No!
-Heads up! Yes!
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter, some part of you must
have known I wouldn't like any of this.
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>But I went balls-to-the-wall
for this party.
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>Literally, there are balls
all the way to the wall.
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>Right, but I've told you so many times,
I don't like parties.
</p><timestamp>00:20:44</timestamp>
<p>But it's the thought that counts, right?
</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p>That's exactly-- The thought was... Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>-What did you do to the spare bedroom?
-Every room has a theme.
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>And this room's theme is Starbucks.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>-Starbucks is not a theme.
-Can we not fight in the Starbucks?
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>I don't wanna be a couple
who fights at Starbucks.
</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Fine. You did go all out.
</p><timestamp>00:21:09</timestamp>
<p>I really thought you'd like this.
I know you love Starbucks.
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>-I don't love--
-You don't love Starbucks,
you love the independent coffee place,
Starbucks is more convenient.
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah.
-See?
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>I do sometimes listen.
</p><timestamp>00:21:21</timestamp>
<p>-Can I get you a decaf Americano?
-Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:21:24</timestamp>
<p>I know you put a lot of thought into today
and I appreciate that, really--
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>I have a decaf Americano
on the bar for Darren.
</p><timestamp>00:21:31</timestamp>
<p>Is there a Darren here?
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>Says Darren on the cup.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>Thank you. This is very realistic.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>I know, right?
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>You wanna go check out the pool?
I filled it up with Jell-O.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> Ah.
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>I still can't believe I'm 35.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>Would you believe I'm 35?
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>-I'm still mad at you.
-I know.
</p><timestamp>00:21:57</timestamp>
<p>But I don't wanna be.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>Well, I don't want you
to be mad at me either.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>We only have so many days together.
I want every one to be a happy one.
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God.
You don't want me to go to Cordovia.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>-What?!
-You don't think I know what it means
when you say shit like...
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>"We only have so many days together"?
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>-Uh, what?
-"Diane, I love waking up next to you."
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>"Diane, I wish
every day could be like this."
</p><timestamp>00:22:23</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, but--
-"Just the two of us, together."
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>Do you have any idea how that feels
when I'm trying to plan my trip?
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>Okay. You got me!
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>Maybe I don't want my wife,
whom I love, to go off
on a terrifying six-month tour
of the most war-torn,
disease-splattered corners of the planet
with a charming, handsome,
billionaire bachelor.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>What could I be thinking?
I'm such a terrible husband.
</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>
<p>I'm not happy.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>-With me?
-I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>With everything.
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>I wake up in the morning
and I feel like I have no purpose.
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>And I'm 35. And if I don't make
some change in my life,
then this is how
I'm gonna feel forever.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>-Honey--
-But then I think
about Sebastian St. Clair
and going to work with him,
helping people and making a difference.
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>And I feel like I have a reason
to get out of bed.
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p>I didn't know you felt that way.
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>If you told me that,
I would have heard it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you
and think you're a good dog.
</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>Yes, you are. Yes, you are,
and I love your cute, funny face,
but I don't wanna be one
of those couples
that settles into a routine
and never changes.
</p><timestamp>00:23:30</timestamp>
<p>Well, I don't know what to say
because I'm an old dog
and I'm not gonna change.
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>Do you know what I do
while you're at work all day?
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>I mostly just sit right there.
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole
and then I take a nap.
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>And when I hear your car in the driveway,
it is the best part of my day.
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I go insane.
</p><timestamp>00:23:52</timestamp>
<p>I know, and I love you so much,
but you're never going
to be my only priority like that.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>That's just not how I'm wired.
</p><timestamp>00:24:01</timestamp>
<p>I need to also live my life.
</p><timestamp>00:24:03</timestamp>
<p>Well... okay.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>Is it okay?
</p><timestamp>00:24:08</timestamp>
<p>If I change and try new things
and you still love me?
</p><timestamp>00:24:14</timestamp>
<p>And you just stay the same person
you've always been and I still love you?
</p><timestamp>00:24:17</timestamp>
<p>Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me.
Does that work for you?
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I think that works.
</p><timestamp>00:24:25</timestamp>
<p>Just don't throw me
any more surprise parties, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p>Uh, yeah, noted.
</p><timestamp>00:24:31</timestamp>
<p>I can't believe you got me a ball pit.
</p><timestamp>00:24:33</timestamp>
<p>And you're saying no part of you wants
to go jump in that ball pit right now?
</p><timestamp>00:24:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Diane</subtitle> Well, maybe a little.
</p><timestamp>00:24:39</timestamp>
<p>-Does that make me a hypocrite?
-No, it just means you changed.
</p><timestamp>00:24:42</timestamp>
<p>It's one of the things I love about you.
</p><timestamp>00:24:49</timestamp>
<p>Surprise!
</p><timestamp>00:24:52</timestamp>
<p>Hello? Anybody?
</p><timestamp>00:24:54</timestamp>
<p>This is Paul McCartney.
</p><timestamp>00:24:57</timestamp>
<p>I came all this way to jump out of a cake?
Honest.
</p><timestamp>00:25:01</timestamp>
<p>With a new suit on... Aye-yai-yai.
