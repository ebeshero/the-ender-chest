</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>Mind if I put you on hold one second?
</p><timestamp>00:00:51</timestamp>
<p>Don't put me on hold.
Do you know who I am?
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>I just won a Baby's Choice Award,
the winner of which
has gone to take home the Oscar
seven of the last 15 years.

<p>So, yeah, <i>that </i>BoJack Horseman.

-Talk to me.
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Guy's name is BoJack Horseman.
He's pretty steamed.
</p><timestamp>00:01:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I've tried everything, but we might need
to bring the Closer in on this one.
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>Calm down. We can sort this out
without having to get the Closer involved.
</p><timestamp>00:01:27</timestamp>
<p>Did you offer 26 weeks
at 50 percent off the newsstand price?
</p><timestamp>00:01:30</timestamp>
<p>I went through the entire checklist, sir.
Even offered him a free tote bag.
</p><timestamp>00:01:33</timestamp>
<p>What kind of monster says no
to a tote bag? Good work, rep.
</p><timestamp>00:01:37</timestamp>
<p>You've done all that could be
expected of you. I'll take it from here.
</p><timestamp>00:01:42</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, Got it. Right.
I understand. I'll take it from here.
</p><timestamp>00:01:46</timestamp>
<p>God help us...
</p><timestamp>00:01:47</timestamp>
<p>Is what I'd say if we needed God's help.
Fortunately, we got one better.
</p><timestamp>00:01:51</timestamp>
<p>Morning. Good morning.
How was your weekend? How are you?
</p><timestamp>00:01:54</timestamp>
<p>Good work yesterday.
Get out of my way, please.

<p>Thank you. I'll take it from here.
</p><timestamp>00:02:06</timestamp>
<p>Hello, good morning, and I say this

<p>{\an8}But before we dig in,

<p>{\an8}A glass of ice water perhaps?

<p>{\an8}Yeah, sure, I'd love a glass of ice water.

<p>{\an8}I see you've been receiving
our paper for six months,
</p><timestamp>00:03:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}but there's no record of you
ever registering a complaint.
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}From whence the hostility, counselor?
</p><timestamp>00:03:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It wasn't a problem until recently,
because up until a week ago
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}the boy who lives with me used the paper
to make a giant paper-mâché Todd head.
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What was that?
-I live with my best friend, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:03:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Good kid, but sometimes

</p><timestamp>00:04:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Pretty scary, right?

<p>{\an8}Giant Todd Head, of course.
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I've been working on him
for the last six months.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What? Why?
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It all started
when a rustling from the kitchen
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}jostled me from tender slumber.

<p>Someone or something is stealing our food.
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>I made a giant papier-mâché Todd head
to scare it away. Think it'll work?
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>If I made a giant papier-mâché me head,
would you stop eating my food?
</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>You should take this seriously.
We might have an infestation.
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>We do have an infestation, of Todds.
Look at that, they're getting bigger.
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>And? Did the head help to ameliorate
your pest peccadillo?
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>No. Todd abandoned the project as soon
as he started working on Cabracadabra.
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p><i>-What's Cabracadabra?</i>
-That's what I said.
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p>-What's Cabracadabra?
-That's what I said.
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>-What's Cabracadabra?
-That's what we want you to say.
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>If I didn't know any better,
you were about to pitch an idea.
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>-We <i>are </i>about to pitch you an idea.
-I did not know better.
</p><timestamp>00:05:24</timestamp>
<p>Has this ever happened to you?
Hey, where you headed?
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yes. That happens to me all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>-We're not at the main part yet.
-I'm so sorry. Please continue.
</p><timestamp>00:05:34</timestamp>
<p>-To the opera, good sir.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>Am I watching to see if the whole thing
has happened to me?
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>-Or looking for one specific thing?
-Kind of both.
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p>So I just keep watching until I see
something that has happened to me?
</p><timestamp>00:05:46</timestamp>
<p>-Yes.
-What if we get to the end,
none of it has ever happened to me?
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>Maybe just try to put yourself
in Emily's shoes right now.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>Got it. Sorry for the interruption.
Please continue.
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>-So, is this where you live?
-Yes, it is.
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>-Alone or are you in a relationship?
-This hardly seems appropriate.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>Driver, you're starting
to make me feel uncomfortable.
</p><timestamp>00:06:05</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, Todd. What are you doing?
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>Has a creepy driver
ever given you his number
or told you that you reminded him
of his dead girlfriend?
</p><timestamp>00:06:15</timestamp>
<p>Or repeated your address slowly,
like he was trying to memorize it?
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>-No, never.
-Unfortunately, if you are a woman
all those things
would happen to you every day.
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>That's right, Todd.
According to my own research,
nine out of ten men
are total dirtbag creeps, just the worst.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>But what if there was a ride-share service
that could guarantee
no creepy men drivers
because there are no men drivers at all?
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>What are you saying, robot drivers?
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>What if they become sentient
and try to murder us, or unionize?
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>That could be a real headache.
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>No, not murderous robots. Women.
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>Todd, you have done it again.
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p>Actually, Emily and I
came up with it together.
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>Todd and Emily,
you've done it again for the first time.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>And that's why we're setting up shop
at your house.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>Why does it have to be my house?
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>There's no room
at Mr. Peanutbutter's house.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>It's full of spaghetti strainers.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>-Why?
-Who can recall?
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>I figure the longer they're there,
the bigger the payoff.
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>And they've been sitting there
for months now.
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>So you can bet
the payoff's going to be pretty huge.

<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> <i>I felt guilty.</i>
<subtitle>The Closer</subtitle> <i>About what?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> <i>Todd had this old girlfriend.</i>
<i>I met her a couple weeks back.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>-Hey.
-Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:07:38</timestamp>
<p>-What are you still doing up?
-I got thirsty.
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>Then you came to the right place.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>Should we call Todd,
see if he wants to join us?
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>I'm tired of trying to figure out
what Todd wants.
</p><timestamp>00:07:49</timestamp>
<p>And what do you want?
</p><timestamp>00:07:51</timestamp>
<p>-I'll start with a whiskey.
-My kind of girl.
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>-So then we had sex.
-What? Why?
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>I was lonely? She was there?
Why does anyone have sex with anyone?
</p><timestamp>00:08:00</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>-You should go.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>That was a mistake.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>Agreed. A wonderful, sexy mistake
for you and a regular mistake for me.
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>No, it was a regular mistake for me, too.
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>-What are we gonna tell Todd?
-Nothing, obviously.
</p><timestamp>00:08:25</timestamp>
<p>-I don't want to hurt him.
-Neither do I.
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>-That's why we won't tell him.
-I feel like we should tell him.
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>That feeling is you selfishly
trying to assuage your guilt.
</p><timestamp>00:08:32</timestamp>
<p>If you cared about Todd,
you would keep this a secret forever.
</p><timestamp>00:08:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm not good at lying.
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p>Ask me if when I was a little girl,
did I ever used to put a stuffed animal
in my underpants
and rock back and forth on it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>When you were a little girl,
did you ever do that thing you said?
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>What? Get-- <subtitle>stammers</subtitle> No!
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>I think it's gonna be fine.
Why would it even come up?
</p><timestamp>00:08:52</timestamp>
<p>Not like there's any reason
the three of us
would ever be in a room together again.
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, you remember Emily, right?
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>-I've never seen you before in my life.
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>-You don't remember BoJack?
-Oh, yeah. BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>What... why... What are you here?
Why are you doing at Todd's house?
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>Todd's house? This is my house.
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>It's cool if we set up shop here, right?
That's not gonna be weird?
</p><timestamp>00:09:12</timestamp>
<p>What? Why would that be weird?
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p>-What are you implying?
-Nothing.
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>It's not weird for me either,
if we're keeping track of weirdnesses.
</p><timestamp>00:09:19</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, what is going on here?
-Why would you? I don't even--
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>-Literally nothing going on.
-No, something's going on.
</p><timestamp>00:09:26</timestamp>
<p>I've got a nose for news.
</p><timestamp>00:09:27</timestamp>
<p>In this case, Nu is the Greek letter
representing the variable
for "What Is Going On?"
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>So let's solve for Nu, shall we?
</p><timestamp>00:09:34</timestamp>
<p>I think someone's not saying something
to someone else about something.
</p><timestamp>00:09:39</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. That is exactly what it is.
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p>Yes. Your stupid business
is gonna be very successful.
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>-Yes.
-Glad that's out in the open.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>We all know what everyone was thinking,
we don't need to ask
any more questions
or do any wondering about mysteries.
</p><timestamp>00:09:59</timestamp>
<p>Nope.
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>If you'll excuse me,
I need to go watch a sport.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>Great idea.
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>The worst part is things have actually

</p><timestamp>00:10:07</timestamp>
<p>Our friendship is in a really good place.
</p><timestamp>00:10:09</timestamp>

<p>"Did you know the wiener dog
is neither a wiener nor a dog?"

<p><i>I gotta drive all the way home to get it.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p><i>When I got there,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p><i>Suddenly, I remember:</i>

</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p><i>It was in my car the entire time.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>Because I was driving back and forth
so much, I ran out of gas.
</p><timestamp>00:11:39</timestamp>
<p>I pulled into a 76.
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>I was about to pump the gas,
I realized I didn't have my credit card,
when I remembered
it was on my desk at home
because I used it to contribute to
my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>Diane...
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>Have you donated
to Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet?
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, shit.
-Throw her 50 bucks. You can afford it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but I don't like feeling
like I have to, Roxy.
</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p>Does the world need
a stop-motion short film
about a pig who goes to circus school?
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>Think of it like you're doing
a nice thing for your friend.
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>Mmm... okay.
</p><timestamp>00:12:06</timestamp>
<p><i>I called a cab to take me home</i>
<i>to get my credit card.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>Then back to the gas station, get my car,
fill it up and come here.
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>So that's why I'm late.
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>-Why did you tell us that whole story?
-I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>-Why did you tell me that whole story?
-I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, I had the ad agency whip up
some options for the new <i>Secretariat </i>ads.
</p><timestamp>00:12:27</timestamp>
<p>Good news is the movie
is killing out there. Everyone loves it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:30</timestamp>
<p>If everyone loves it,
why do we need a new ad campaign?
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>These are
the "For Your Consideration" ads.
</p><timestamp>00:12:35</timestamp>
<p>They're a reminder to the Academy,
"Have you considered this yet?"
</p><timestamp>00:12:38</timestamp>
<p>The Academy doesn't always
consider everything.
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p>So they need constant
consideration reminders.
</p><timestamp>00:12:44</timestamp>
<p>-That's very considerate.
-This one tested the best.
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>That's a good one.
The rest of these suck.
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>Dumb. Dumb. Stupid. Offensive.
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>Ugly. Boring. Typical. Stupid.
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>Bad. Hideous. Disgusting. Gross. Cliché.
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>-I am really good at this.
-Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>-I kind of like this one.
-How'd that piece of crap get in there?
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>We ruled that one out.
</p><timestamp>00:13:03</timestamp>
<p>It's actually really powerful.
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>The Closer</subtitle> <i>What spoke to you</i>

</p><timestamp>00:13:19</timestamp>
<p>Of course you like this ad.

you see Secretariat, I see an old turtle.
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>"Hello, old turtle. Are you Secretariat?
No? You're just some old turtle?
</p><timestamp>00:13:27</timestamp>
<p>-What the hell? You've aged terribly."
-But you've got the heart of a champion.
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p>I got a team of cardiologists at Cedars
who say different.
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>Isn't that the point of the movie,
that anybody could be Secretariat?
</p><timestamp>00:13:36</timestamp>
<p>The point of the movie is to make
a lot of money and win awards.
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>If anyone who looks at this ad
is Secretariat,
why should you win the Oscar?
</p><timestamp>00:13:43</timestamp>

That's a mixed metaphor.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>-But... you're right.
<i>-Great.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm going to sign you up
for another six months.
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>Since you've been such a sport,
I'm throwing in a tote bag.
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>Thanks.
You've given me a lot to think about.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so I'm a passenger.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>Remember the three D's:
drive safely, drive efficiently,
and don't harass the passenger.
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>-Todd, can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure. Driver, pull over, please.

</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p>Driver, put up the partition, please.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>imitating partition whirring</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>I've been thinking,
and you should do this without me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>What? But the whole point
is we're doing it together.
</p><timestamp>00:22:17</timestamp>
<p>But you don't need me anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>You have a whole team of coders,
and I don't think that I can work
in this house.
</p><timestamp>00:22:23</timestamp>
<p>-What's wrong with the house?
-Todd, I just--
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>-I need to go.
-<subtitle>imitating opening door</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p>I don't understand.
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>Did I do something
to make you feel uncomfortable?
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>No. You are great. It's me and... BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>BoJack? <subtitle>sighing</subtitle>
What did he do this time?
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p>I don't think
I've been a very good friend to you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>
<p>Things happened and...
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>
<p>I don't think BoJack's been
a very good friend to you either.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, okay.
-You should buy me out of the company.
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>No, no, no, keep your share.
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>Who knows?
It might be worth something someday.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>You're sweet, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>You shouldn't waste that on people
who don't deserve it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you want this plum?
I found it in the kitchen.
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>smoke bomb fizzing</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>How did you know where I live?
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>-Ana...
-You need to leave.
</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>No, I know that it's exciting
to remain mysterious and in control,
but control is a myth.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>That's a conclusion
I came to recently by myself.
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>I can't do this now.
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to go home tonight.
I want to sleep in your bed,
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p>I wanna see what
you look like waking up.
</p><timestamp>00:23:33</timestamp>
<p>You are a beautiful,
sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p>And I want to know you.
I'm not afraid of that.
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p>And you don't have to be, either.
</p><timestamp>00:23:44</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>And I want to go with the mirror ads
for <i>Secretariat.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack, no, listen.
-Ana.
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>This is my campaign,
I know what I'm doing.
</p><timestamp>00:23:52</timestamp>
<p>Call up Turteltaub and tell him
I won't be pushed around on this.
</p><timestamp>00:23:55</timestamp>
<p>I'm the star and what I say goes.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>cars honking</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:03</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Ana</subtitle> Hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:24:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Carolyn</subtitle> It kind of just looks like
a billboard for the sky.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>-I didn't think this part through.
-No kidding.
</p><timestamp>00:24:09</timestamp>
<p>The sky is Secretariat? The sky
wants you to nominate it for an Oscar?
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>It is eerily beautiful.
</p><timestamp>00:24:14</timestamp>
<p>Like an art piece
that resists interpretation.
</p><timestamp>00:24:17</timestamp>
<p>Oh, good. Yeah. Wouldn't want the ad
for my movie to be interpretable.
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>If you stand where I'm standing,
you see a reflection
of the KIIS-FM billboard.
</p><timestamp>00:24:25</timestamp>
<p>Beautiful. So we spent half a million
dollars on an Oscar campaign for KIIS-FM.
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p>I'd hate to drive here at rush hour.
</p><timestamp>00:24:30</timestamp>
<p>When the sun goes down
and hits that billboard,
that's gonna--
That's gonna be a real problem.
</p><timestamp>00:24:36</timestamp>
<p>Well, the good news is
BoJack got what he wanted.
