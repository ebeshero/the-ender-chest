<p>BoJack,
it's your favorite agent.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, some agent,
you couldn't even get me
in the room for <i>War Horse.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:59</timestamp>
<p>There were, like,
ten horses in that movie.

to make sure you're all set

a bunch of personal questions?

<p>Okay, all right,
there's no need to get--

<p>What, catty?
Are you gonna say catty?
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>- I was not gonna say catty.
- Oh, what were you gonna say?
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p>I was gonna say catty
because you're a cat.

<p>Take another one.
</p><timestamp>00:01:41</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me,
I just wanted you to know
that you ruined
someone else's night tonight,
and I hope
you have enough decency
to at least feel
a little bit crappy about it.
</p><timestamp>00:01:50</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me?
</p><timestamp>00:01:52</timestamp>
<p>I was actually
already in a bad mood,
but I thought maybe
for one night,
</p><timestamp>00:01:55</timestamp>
<p>I could go out to a bar
and try to forget about myself,
but now because of you
and your friends,
</p><timestamp>00:02:00</timestamp>
<p>I feel more self-conscious
than ever.
</p><timestamp>00:02:02</timestamp>
<p>If we were bothering you
so much,
why didn't you just leave?
</p><timestamp>00:02:05</timestamp>
<p>Because I didn't think
of that, and now I feel stupid.
</p><timestamp>00:02:07</timestamp>
<p>Look, I have a right
to be here.
</p><timestamp>00:02:09</timestamp>
<p>No!
</p><timestamp>00:02:10</timestamp>
<p>Maybe because you're skinny
and maybe 'cause you're pretty,
you're used to getting away
with things,
but I want you to know
that your actions
have an effect on others,
and I hate you,
and you are a horrible person,
and you not understanding
that you're a horrible person
doesn't make you
less of a horrible person.

<p>Also, please don't put
in my book
that I use horse tranquilizers,

a much, much larger dose

</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>Did you bring them

<p>No, but I was

You had dibs?
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, dibs.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>I just put them down
for a second
while I went to the bathroom.
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>Look, I don't even
want the muffins.
</p><timestamp>00:07:07</timestamp>
<p>I was just looking at them,
but I got to say,
if you put muffins down,
they're not your muffins.
</p><timestamp>00:07:11</timestamp>
<p>So what, I was supposed
to take them
into the bathroom with me?
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>You didn't even
put the muffins in a cart.
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>You just left them out here.
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>Yeah,
in the produce section.
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p>Clearly, muffins aren't supposed
to be in the produce section.
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>That wasn't a sign to you that
maybe someone else had dibs?
</p><timestamp>00:07:24</timestamp>
<p>Look, I don't want to get
into a whole thing here.
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>Then give me the muffins.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>No, 'cause maybe now
I want the muffins.
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>You think that because
you're a pseudo-celebrity,
normal rules don't
apply to you?

<p>I'm gonna regret
buying muffins?
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>What, have they got a lot
of saturated fat in them?
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>Oh, man, they do have
a lot of saturated fat.
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p>Why'd I buy these?

and then eating them all
on the drive home.
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>

with Ayako went really well.
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>Thanks for asking.
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p>I specifically didn't ask,
and I'll thank you to respect
my total lack of interest
in your personal life.

</p><timestamp>00:08:41</timestamp>

at the beginning.
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>What was your childhood like?
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>- Normal.
- Normal?
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, it was, uh, normal--
normal childhood stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>Here's your omelet.
</p><timestamp>00:08:52</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry it's not as good
as the omelets
your secretary makes,
but then you're not married
to your secretary, are you?
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>Well, maybe if my secretary
also refused to get an abortion,
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>I would be.
</p><timestamp>00:09:02</timestamp>
<p>Mommy,
can I have an omelet?
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>You're the birthday boy.
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>Normal childhood,
and then just get right
into the big, famous part.
</p><timestamp>00:09:12</timestamp>
<p>Look, if you're not
ready to talk, we can wait.
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>I am ready to talk.
</p><timestamp>00:09:15</timestamp>
<p>Why wouldn't I want
to talk about my parents?
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>They're so normal.
That's crazy.

</p><timestamp>00:18:43</timestamp>
<p>I'm helping!
Hooray!
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p>So where are
we gonna do this?
</p><timestamp>00:18:47</timestamp>
<p>Do I have to go on MSNBSea?
</p><timestamp>00:18:49</timestamp>
<p>No, we should do it somewhere
people will actually see it.
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>Oh, why don't you do it
on <i>Peanutbutter and Jelly</i>?
</p><timestamp>00:18:54</timestamp>
<p>You can't call a show
<i>Peanutbutter and Jelly</i>
if there's no jelly.
</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>It's a pun.
</p><timestamp>00:19:00</timestamp>
<p>It's not a pun
if it only works one way.
</p><timestamp>00:19:02</timestamp>
<p>Is this
a necessary conversation
to be having right now?
</p><timestamp>00:19:05</timestamp>
<p>Look, I know
tempers are high,
but let's not take it out
on the great title
for my reality show,
which we all agree
is really clever.
</p><timestamp>00:19:13</timestamp>
<p>We can edit this to make me
look smart, right?
</p><timestamp>00:19:16</timestamp>
<p><music> Yeah</music>
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>

<p>How's this look?
Looks good?
</p><timestamp>00:19:20</timestamp>
<p>- Okay.
- Marker, sound, speed.
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p>Well, here I am, hanging out
with my good friend
BoJack Horseman,
enjoying
each other's company,
as we often do.
</p><timestamp>00:19:31</timestamp>
<p>Yes, this is all
very authentic and natural.
</p><timestamp>00:19:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>doorbell rings</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:34</timestamp>
<p>Oh, someone's at the door!
</p><timestamp>00:19:36</timestamp>
<p>I will see who it is.
</p><timestamp>00:19:41</timestamp>
<p>Wow, this is a surprise.
</p><timestamp>00:19:43</timestamp>
<p>Neal McBeal.
</p><timestamp>00:19:44</timestamp>
<p>Hello, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:19:46</timestamp>
<p>Thank you for inviting me
into your home. It is lovely.
</p><timestamp>00:19:49</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, is there anything
you'd like to give Neal McBeal?
</p><timestamp>00:19:54</timestamp>
<p>Ahem.
</p><timestamp>00:19:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah, Todd?
</p><timestamp>00:19:57</timestamp>
<p>What the hell is this?
</p><timestamp>00:19:59</timestamp>
<p>I tried to buy the muffins,
but my bank card got declined
for some reason.
</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>But don't worry,
I still saved the day
because I found this bag
of stale hamburger buns.
</p><timestamp>00:20:08</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry?
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, they're just giving them
away behind In-N-Out.
</p><timestamp>00:20:12</timestamp>
<p>Why does anybody
pay for anything?
</p><timestamp>00:20:15</timestamp>
<p>Ow.
</p><timestamp>00:20:16</timestamp>
<p>Uh, Neal, as a token
of my admiration,
please accept this bag
of stale hamburger buns.
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>- What?
- Yes, hamburger buns.
</p><timestamp>00:20:26</timestamp>
<p>It's a symbol
for how we throw our veterans
in the trash, sadly,
far too often.
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>I'm listening.
</p><timestamp>00:20:34</timestamp>
<p>We send
our muffins overseas,
and they come back
as stale hamburger buns,
but that doesn't mean
we should love them any less,
because in their own way,
aren't stale hamburger buns
just as good?
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>Mmm.
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>American made.
</p><timestamp>00:20:51</timestamp>
<p>So what you're saying is,
you think I'm a hero.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>Well, I don't know if I--
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>Say it, BoJack.
Say I'm a hero.
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>You're a hero.
</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>The troops are all heroes,
every single one.
</p><timestamp>00:21:09</timestamp>
<p>Great.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>And I don't believe
saying that cheapens the word
and actually disrespects
those we mean to honor
by turning real people
into political pawns.
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>Okay, you can let go
of the bag now.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>Also, I am not
deeply ambivalent
about a seemingly mandated
celebration of our military
by a nation
that claims to value peace
telling our children that
violence is never the answer
while refusing to hold our own
government to the same standard.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, me neither.
I think we're in agreement here.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>Furthermore, I do not find
it unbelievably appropriate
that this conversation is taking
place on reality television,
a genre which thrives on
chopping the complexities
of our era
into easily digestible chunks
of empty catchphrases.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>And finally, I don't--
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbutter
got a bucket stuck on his head.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>Guys, guys, where am I?
Can someone tell me where I am?
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>Hey, where'd he get
that bucket from?
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>Who gave him a bucket?
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>Uh, actually, I had
another point I wanted to make.
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but who doesn't love
a dog with a bucket on his head?
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>Come on.
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>Bucket! Bucket!
</p><timestamp>00:22:17</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>crowd</subtitle> Bucket!
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>Bucket! Bucket!
Bucket! Bucket!
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>Hey, can anyone
find a handle?
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>howls</subtitle>
<subtitle>all cheer</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p>Oh, thank you, my friend.
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>You're a real hero.
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>Unbelievable.
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>What's your name, young lady?
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>Well, my real name's Angela,
but my friends call me Jelly.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>What?
Oh, my God, did we get that?
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>Please tell me we got that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuffs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>You want
a day-old hamburger bun?
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>I'm all right.
How'd it go down there?
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p>You know what the problem is
with everybody?
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>They all just want to hear
what they already believe.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>No one ever wants
to hear the truth.
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>I want to hear the truth.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>I don't know if you want
to tell it, though.
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>What do you mean?
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Normal Childhood,
Mr. Uneventful Father?
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>Look, I can write you
the standard
empty-calorie celebrity
tell-some,
if that's what
you're looking for,
but I thought you
might want more than that.
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>I do.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>Well, then you're going
to have to open up
and give me something real.
</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>What, you think
I can't open up?
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>Well, I don't know
if you can or not.
</p><timestamp>00:23:23</timestamp>
<p>You certainly haven't.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>Okay, from now on,
full truth, warts and all.
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p>You're not gonna make me look
like an asshole, are you?
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>I don't know,
are you an asshole?
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>Okay, full truth,
here we go.
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>You want to know
about my parents?
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p>They drank a lot.
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>My father was
a failed novelist.
</p><timestamp>00:23:46</timestamp>
<p>My mother was the heiress to the
Sugarman sugar cubes fortune,
and my dad
resented her for it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>He used to make me cry
with him
while listening
to Cole Porter records.
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p>He made me build
my own tree house,
and then he tore it down
while I was at summer camp
because instead of
hearty, Christian nails,
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>I used screws,
which he called fancy Jew nails.
</p><timestamp>00:24:04</timestamp>
<p>Like I said, totally normal.
