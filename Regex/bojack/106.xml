Mwah.

<p>BoJack Horseman!
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>- Put her there!
- That's all right.
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna get
that handshake.
</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>No, you're not.
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
Since when am I Honey?
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>Since now.
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>I made up the nickname
while you were back east.
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, really? You made up
calling someone honey?
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>Uh, I do believe so. Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>Hey, why don't we give
BoJack a ride?
</p><timestamp>00:00:37</timestamp>
<p>That's okay.
Todd's supposed to pick me up.

<p>Probably just forgot,
the lazy bum.
</p><timestamp>00:00:52</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I'll take the ride
as long as it's not as bumpy
as that pilot's landing.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>That was seriously
very scary.
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>- Hey...
- I'm just glad you were there,
because I really would have
freaked out by myself.
</p><timestamp>00:01:02</timestamp>
<p>Be stiller,
my beating heart.
</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p>Stiller crazy
after all these years.
</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
- Did I miss something funny?
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p>- I love funny somethings.
- No, we were just laughing
about this Ben Stiller article
from the plane.
</p><timestamp>00:01:12</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
- Ooh, he is the best.
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p>- What did it say?
- You wouldn't get it.
</p><timestamp>00:01:15</timestamp>
<p>Either you read <i>Hemisphere's</i>
<i>Magazine, </i>or you don't.
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I might be crazy, because
this is such a dumb question,
and I'm embarrassed
to even ask,
but do I have anything to worry
about with you and Diane?
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:01:29</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
What?
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>Get out of here.
</p><timestamp>00:01:34</timestamp>
<p>I got to say, BoJack,
that is a relief.

<p>Hey, do you guys
want to grab dinner?
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Or at least some road sodas,
</p><timestamp>00:02:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so I don't have
to go through the ordeal
</p><timestamp>00:02:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}of sobering up and then having
to get drunk all over again?
</p><timestamp>00:02:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, I actually already made
special plans
</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}for just the two of us.
</p><timestamp>00:02:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, come on.
</p><timestamp>00:02:48</timestamp>
<p>You're the one
who's always saying
you want to hang out
with BoJack more,
and how it's weird that BoJack
never returns your calls,
and how I should
hang up the phone
because maybe BoJack's
trying to call you right now.
</p><timestamp>00:02:56</timestamp>
<p>Uh, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:02:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I guess we can
make this work.
</p><timestamp>00:03:01</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
- Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:03:03</timestamp>
<p>Oh, man.
Remember that guy in 34-B?
</p><timestamp>00:03:05</timestamp>
<p>Do I? Can't stop
remembering him.
</p><timestamp>00:03:08</timestamp>
<p>Uh, hey.
Diane and I have memories, too.
</p><timestamp>00:03:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}This place reminds me
of a cliffside meal we had
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}one romantic vacay to Cabo.
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>Boring. I wasn't there.
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>Can we keep this
general interests?
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, here's to a meal
we're all here for.
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p>Mmm.
</p><timestamp>00:03:24</timestamp>
<p>Oh, oh. Ew.
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>There's something
in my food.
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>Ah, crap.
Someone get the manager.
</p><timestamp>00:03:28</timestamp>
<p>No, no, no. Wait.
</p><timestamp>00:03:30</timestamp>
<p>It's supposed to be in there.
Welcome home, honey.
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I got you a D pendant,
because I am D-pendant on you.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>- Thank you.
- Yeah. Real-- Real cute.
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>- A D for dog.
- It's for Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:03:42</timestamp>
<p>This is the sweetest choking
hazard anyone's ever given me.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>moans</subtitle>
- Mwah.
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>Well, how about some champagne
for the happy couple.
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Waiter, get me
a bottle of Dom
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}to keep with the trend
of sweet D gifts.
</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>
<p>You're too kind,
but everyone knows you go off
menu for the good stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yes, get me your most expensive
bottle from the back.
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Perhaps a 1922-ish Heidsieck
Diamant Bleu?
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A toast on me
to Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>I'd like a round of drinks
for everyone.
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>Off the menu, of course.
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- <subtitle>all cheering</subtitle>
- BoJack, folks. What a sport.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And while we're all
in giving moods,
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'd like to buy you all an Xbox,
courtesy of me.
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all cheering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>Wow. You guys don't
have to do this.
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>Look, I could happily
go down this petty road
of raising and re-raising
one another.
</p><timestamp>00:04:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man</subtitle> Please do!
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But I'd instead
like to highlight the fact
that Mr. Peanutbutter's
ripping off my toast
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}the same way he ripped off
my entire career.
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man 2</subtitle> Uh, we prefer gifts
over observations.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Well, here's something
I didn't rip off.
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>This brand new helicopter
I just bought.
</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>Whoo-whoo! Who wants a ride
in the chopper?
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>applause and cheering</subtitle>
- Okay, guys. This has been fun,
and also an offensive display
of extravagant wealth,
but maybe we should
call it a night.
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>What's the rush?
</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>Because I just bought
the restaurant,
and we can stay
as long as we want.
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>all cheering</subtitle>
- Hey, you. I own you now.
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>- Do a dance.
- <subtitle>scats</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>Oops.
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
Oh, no. Hey, sorry, bud.
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>- It's all yours.
- Please, you first.
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>Apparently, we both
like to be clean.
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>I love being clean.
That's so coincidental.
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>- I'm Todd.
- Klaus.
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>Look, I know
you're new here,
but we have a lot in common:
being white, into cleansing.
</p><timestamp>00:05:23</timestamp>
<p>I think you'd enjoy hanging out
with me and the gang.
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>When you say "the gang,"
do you mean a gang?
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>Check this out.
If you want to lift weights,
we got great yard
connections.

we spent the past 20 years
perfecting pruno.

spin on Nazis.
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>Hey, tell you what.
Drop by our party tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>Shoot the shit with the guys,
mostly about Jews,
and make up your own mind.
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>Until then,
take my card.
</p><timestamp>00:05:51</timestamp>
<p>Whoa. Uh, where were you
keeping that card?
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>both</subtitle> Forty-five, forty-six,
forty-seven...
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>Guys, can we give this thing
a rest?
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>Rest? Why rest?
I'm not tired.
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>I'm twice as not tired.

from the airport
like a goddamn
environmentalist.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry,
but I'm in jail, dude.
</p><timestamp>00:06:26</timestamp>

<p>Are you ill,
or hung-over?
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p>Because instead of coughing
you just said the word cough.

drunken voicemail last night.
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, was it bad?

<p>It was mostly a lot

dragging something heavy
at least a few miles.

<p>As incriminating

<p>Good. Well, just as
a general rule,
you probably shouldn't
be listening
to any voicemails
I leave after--

<p>- What time do I start drinking?
- Noon?
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>- Yup. See you later.
- But we had an appointment.

<p>What's that? An actor flaking
on an obligation?
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>- Welcome to Hollywood.

</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>

<p>Are you in love

<p>You stole the D for Diane.
Unbelievable.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I don't know.
The D might be for David,
because apparently
when I was drunk,
</p><timestamp>00:09:26</timestamp>
<p>I printed out a bunch
of pictures of David Boreanaz.
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. You did that.

<p>Look, I'll keep your little

for you to get rid
of the contraband,
but the next three weddings
I'm invited to,
you're my date, dummy.
</p><timestamp>00:09:38</timestamp>
<p>Since when to women your age
get invited to weddings?

you deviant.
</p><timestamp>00:09:46</timestamp>
<p>Get it? D-viant?
</p><timestamp>00:09:49</timestamp>
<p>- I got it.

how are you gonna complete
your giant bracelet?
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>With the chain-link fence
from Dodger's Stadium?
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>No. How'd you figure out
it was me?
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>Oh, how did I figure it out?
Well, I just followed the clues,
used deduction, puzzle-solving,
a little bit of forensics,
and also,
what did I do?
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I listened to the voicemail
you left me
saying you were stealing the D
because of Diane
so I could, and I quote,
"Suck your D."
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>Stop leaving voicemails!
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>Admit it!
You like my girlfriend.
</p><timestamp>00:10:17</timestamp>
<p>Oh, come on. I mean,
am I attracted to her? Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>Do my days feel better
when I'm around her? Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:10:22</timestamp>
<p>Does she get me in ways
no woman ever has? Indubitably.
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>Do I fantasize about her?
Yes, but only in two positions.
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>
<p>Look, am I the kind of guy
who would try to steal
someone else's girlfriend?
</p><timestamp>00:10:31</timestamp>
<p>Sure, of course,
but do I like her?
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>
<p>The answer's no.
You have nothing to worry about.
</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>I'll cut you a deal.
</p><timestamp>00:10:36</timestamp>
<p>I help you get rid
of that D,
and you never talk
to Diane again.
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>Well, I have to talk to her,
because she's writing my book.
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>Okay, but just don't
pursue her romantically?
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>- Deal.
- Ha!
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>- I knew I'd get that handshake.

</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:11:03</timestamp>
<p>- Oh!
- ...at the same time?
</p><timestamp>00:11:05</timestamp>
<p>Look, I saw you talking
to Klaus in the shower.
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>Now, the Aryans are good guys,
don't get me wrong.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>But I don't know
if you're gonna get
the right attention
over there.
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>Uh, I'd hate to get lost
in a shop that big.
</p><timestamp>00:11:17</timestamp>
<p>Now we can't
offer you the works,
but in the Latin Kings,
you'll be a star.
</p><timestamp>00:11:21</timestamp>
<p>We're number two,

</p><timestamp>00:11:24</timestamp>
<p>Am I really being courted
by two gangs?
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I feel like
the belle of the ball.
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>So, this is the shapeless
biographer
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>I've heard so much about.
</p><timestamp>00:11:36</timestamp>
<p>We've met several times.
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>Did you just call me here
to insult me?
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>What is your secret, lady?
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>I mean, how do you get
two grown men fighting over you
like a foul ball
at a football game?
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>First of all, football doesn't
have foul balls.
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>Ugh, sports.
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>Second of all,
nobody's fighting over me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>Open your eyes.
</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p>BoJack's clearly
in love with you.
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>Wha--?
</p><timestamp>00:12:01</timestamp>
<p>Get out of here!
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p>Get out of here?
Why would I get out of here?
</p><timestamp>00:12:04</timestamp>
<p>You get out of here.
This is my office.
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>I get the army men are police,
but what's the mustard packet
again?
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's just
a mustard packet.
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>- It's left over from lunch.
- Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>Well, can we move it
off the table?
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p>No. I still might
want it later.
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>Good call.
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>So how do we get
the D from here
all the way up to here?
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p>What, with all these cops
and mustards,
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>- it's gonna be a pickle.
- Oh, no.
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>The pickle's a SWAT van,
but I see your point.
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>Might be easier to just ditch
the evidence. But how?
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>I-- I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:12:34</timestamp>
<p>You think these coffees
would get the juices flowing.
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p>Well, they do have Bailey's
in them.
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>Is that why I feel drunk?
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p>Because I've had, like,
seven or eight coffees.
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I admit,
it's been bad for ideas,
but it's been great
for camaraderie.
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>Couldn't agree more.
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, hey.
What time is it?
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>I probably need
to move my helicopter.
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>It's in a two-hour zone.
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>You beautiful bastard,
that's it!
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>We can pick up the D with your
chopper, fly it out of here,
and then dump it
out into the ocean.
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>Stupendous!
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>Take that, the ocean.

<p>- What now, Todd?
<i>- Listen.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:13:05</timestamp>
<p>So, kind of landed myself in a
two-dates-to-the-prom situation.
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>
<p>The dates being prison gangs
and the prom being a jump-in,
so do you remember how you got
out of the same jam
on <i>Horsin' Around?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>Ah, a classic conundrum.
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>Well, I recall one time
on <i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House--</i>
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>I think he's talking to me,
pal.
</p><timestamp>00:13:22</timestamp>
<p>You know, the guy
whose show
invented the
two-dates-to-the-prom story.
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>You may have invented it, but
I think our show perfected it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:29</timestamp>
<p>The only thing
you ever perfected
</p><timestamp>00:13:30</timestamp>
<p>- was stealing my thunder.
- Stealing your thunder, eh?
</p><timestamp>00:13:32</timestamp>
<p>Now you're even stealing
the words I'm saying.
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p><i>You know, it's tough.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>I agree with the Latin Kings
on social issues,
but fiscally
I'm more of an Aryan.
</p><timestamp>00:13:40</timestamp>
<p>Well, juggling both
never ends well.
</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter,
anything to contribute?
</p><timestamp>00:13:44</timestamp>
<p>He's just staring blankly now.
</p><timestamp>00:13:46</timestamp>
<p>Stealing your thunder.
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>You could also just
bail me out of here, as I said.
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p><i>- It's only 50 bucks--</i>
- Got to go, pal.
</p><timestamp>00:13:53</timestamp>
<p>Hope it's a magical night.
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>All right,
you ready for the plan?
</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah.

</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>You leave that to me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:04</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, wait.
You had a lot to drink.
</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p>You better have
a cup of coffee.

<p>Wow. I never knew neo-Nazis
were so interested in Nazis.
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>You got some great moves,
Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:18:53</timestamp>
<p>You dance like a white man,
and I love it.
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>
<p>Hey, no disrespect,
but I got a few chess pieces
I forgot need whittling.

Oh, excuse me.
</p><timestamp>00:19:03</timestamp>
<p>Oh, thank God
you're back.
</p><timestamp>00:19:05</timestamp>
<p>I was getting nervous that
you left me for another gang.
</p><timestamp>00:19:08</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:19:10</timestamp>
<p>If that happened,
I'd have to kill you.

<p>Thank you
for rescheduling
given your recent, uh,
everything.
</p><timestamp>00:19:23</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. That was really
something.
</p><timestamp>00:19:25</timestamp>
<p>I guess he makes
your heart stand Stiller?
</p><timestamp>00:19:28</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but for some reason
the jury's Stiller out
on how I feel about it.
</p><timestamp>00:19:33</timestamp>
<p>Well, that's because
it wasn't for you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:35</timestamp>
<p>That wasn't a Diane thing.
It was a Mr. Peanutbutter thing.
</p><timestamp>00:19:37</timestamp>
<p>Well, what would be
a Diane thing?
</p><timestamp>00:19:39</timestamp>
<p>A Diane thing would be
something that shows
he really knows you,
like giving you an iPod loaded
with all your favorite podcasts,
or a practical houseplant,
or surprising you
with a bound album
of photos and emails
he saved.
</p><timestamp>00:19:52</timestamp>
<p>That's-- That's what the Diane
I know would want.
</p><timestamp>00:19:55</timestamp>
<p>What are you saying to me?
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>Just that you should be
with someone
who knows you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:59</timestamp>
<p>Yeah? Like who?
</p><timestamp>00:20:02</timestamp>
<p>- I--

Were we taping?
</p><timestamp>00:20:05</timestamp>
<p>Um, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:20:06</timestamp>
<p>Uh, you want to hear
my Andy Dick story?
</p><timestamp>00:20:08</timestamp>
<p>It's a doozie.
</p><timestamp>00:20:11</timestamp>
<p>All we ask for is 10%
of anything pilfered.
</p><timestamp>00:20:15</timestamp>
<p>Drugs, cigarettes.
</p><timestamp>00:20:17</timestamp>
<p>I mean, that's the standard
gang rate.
</p><timestamp>00:20:18</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I got to go, uh,
do a prison thing.
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>That sounds legitimate.
We are in prison, after all.

<p>Whew. Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:20:31</timestamp>
<p>White people, right?
</p><timestamp>00:20:33</timestamp>
<p>Todd? Why in the name
of Pat Buchanan
are you dressed
like a Latin King?
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>- Uh, what--
- What the hell, bro?
</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>- Are you playing both sides?
- Look, guys,
</p><timestamp>00:20:42</timestamp>
<p>I didn't want to choose between
you because I like you both.
</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>Look, in fact, if you just
took the time
to get to know each other
the way you did me,
</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>I think you'd agree
we don't need gangs anymore
because, deep down,
we're all just people.

<p>Look, uh, things got
a bit weird earlier,
so I-- I want to make sure
that we're still on for tomorrow
to talk about the time
I sneezed on Marisa Tomei.
</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>I'm really sorry
about before.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>I know the D was overkill,
so I got you something
more personal.
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>Aww.
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>I also wanted to just, um,
let you know
how much I appreciate you
working on this book with me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>I know I sometimes
get carried away,
but it's because
I love you so much.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>You're a catch, Diane,
and I think you know
how much I love catch.
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>And I'm sorry if I've been
difficult in any way
during this process.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>You know, it's-- It's really hard
to have somebody,
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>I don't know, know you,
I guess.
</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p>And you do, uh,
know me, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>We're very different,
but I think we bring out
the best in each other.
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>It's like you're chocolate
and I'm--
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>- Peanutbutter?
- <subtitle>laughs</subtitle> What? Now see?
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>That was so much better
than what I was gonna say.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>- I was gonna say carrots.
- <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>And I know I'm not
the perfect guy.
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>I actually kind of hate myself
a lot of the time.
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>But when-- When I'm with you,
I, uh, don't hate myself.
</p><timestamp>00:22:30</timestamp>
<p>I like being around you,
and I don't know
if I ever told you that
in so many words,
so I'm telling you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>Diane, I've got an important
question to ask.
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>No cameras,
no big spectacle.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>Just me and you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:45</timestamp>
<p>Call me back.
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>

by the way.

<p><subtitle>cell phone chimes</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>...of becoming
Mrs. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>Wow. This is happening
so fast.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>Yes. I'll marry you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>But I'm keeping
my last name.
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>

a voicemail--
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p>Delete it. It's just a drunken
recipe for Bundt cake.
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>Not important.
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p>Okay. I got to go.
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>They're about to move
