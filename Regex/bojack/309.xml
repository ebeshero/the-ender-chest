<p>BoJack! Beautiful day, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>Perfect day to go outside,
not read the trades
or talk to anyone in the industry
or watch entertainment television
or have a gut feeling about the ratings
for your television show last night.
</p><timestamp>00:00:33</timestamp>
<p>- Princess Carolyn, I'm dying.
- You read the trades.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>My heart is in my stomach,
my stomach is in my butt,
and my butt ran away with the spoon.
</p><timestamp>00:00:41</timestamp>
<p>That makes sense
because your butt is quite a dish.
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>Can you come over? I need you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>What the...?
</p><timestamp>00:00:52</timestamp>
<p>I ordered a few feel better pizzas
to feel better. It did not work.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>Then I sprinkled happy pills on them,
and washed it all down
with a "Please, God, make my pain go away"
vermouth and ice cream float.
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>- Somehow I feel worse.
- That's a real mystery.
</p><timestamp>00:01:05</timestamp>
<p>My show was terrible.
Why did I insist on a mockumentary format?
</p><timestamp>00:01:09</timestamp>
<p>It's already an overused trope now,
in 2007.
</p><timestamp>00:01:12</timestamp>
<p>Mockumentary is not a trope,
it's a device for storytelling.
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>And your show is daring and cutting edge.
People just aren't ready.
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, people! It's not me.
</p><timestamp>00:01:22</timestamp>
<p>It's the people that are the problem!
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>Everyone's dumb and I am great.
Why do I always forget that?
</p><timestamp>00:01:27</timestamp>
<p>That's the spirit.
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>I'm starting to think this show is
the best thing that happened to me.
</p><timestamp>00:01:31</timestamp>
<p>- Really?
- Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>It made me realize you're the best thing
that happened to me,
with your sexy cat eyes
and your cute little hair curl.
</p><timestamp>00:01:38</timestamp>
<p>You look like a soft serve
strawberry ice cream.
</p><timestamp>00:01:42</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, we can't. I'm your agent.
</p><timestamp>00:01:44</timestamp>
<p>You are so much more than that.
You're my lighthouse, my Garmin.
</p><timestamp>00:01:48</timestamp>
<p>You're the little plastic table
they put in pizza boxes
to keep the pizza from getting smushed.
</p><timestamp>00:01:52</timestamp>
<p>You're Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:01:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>both moan</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:00</timestamp>
<p>Don't you break my heart,
BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:02:02</timestamp>
<p>- What?
- What? Nothing.
</p><timestamp>00:02:04</timestamp>
<p>- Did you just say something to me?
- No, I was just being wistful, I guess.
</p><timestamp>00:02:07</timestamp>
<p>Well, can you be wistful a little quieter?
</p><timestamp>00:02:10</timestamp>
<p>- Not everyone is interested in your wist.
- Okay, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:02:16</timestamp>
<p>- You smell nice.
- Thanks, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>Carolyn laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Okay, gotta go. I'm about to meet
my most important client.
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- I know you're not really on the phone.
- Bye, Mr. President.
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Give my love to your basketball friends.
You too.
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Should we get dinner,
or are you just thinking drinks?
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- I'm not planning on staying long.
- Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:03:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm glad you wanted to meet,
because I am so pumped to tell you
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}all about the exciting projects
I'm lining up for you.
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That won't be necessary.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Once you get your Oscar nom,
we'll have our pick. That's the key.
</p><timestamp>00:03:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You think Halle Berry
would've been offered <i>Catwoman</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}if she wasn't an Oscar winner?
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We just gotta find you your <i>Catwoman.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm not sure if a <i>Catwoman</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}is really the best thing
for my career right now.
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Right, well, like I said,
we are getting lots of offers.
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Listen, Princess Carolyn--
</p><timestamp>00:04:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>Signore </i>Horseman!
<i>Principessa </i>Carolina!
</p><timestamp>00:04:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sandro, how you doing,
you handsome devil?
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>To be honest I am, how you say,
sweating bull's nets.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>- You mean sweating bullets?
- I don't think so.
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>Sweating bullets.
How does that make the sense?
</p><timestamp>00:04:16</timestamp>
<p>How does sweating bull's nets
make sense?
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I don't want to be caught in bull's nets.
He may try to kiss me.
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I prefer kissing cows. No judgment,
just a preference. I love kissing cows!
</p><timestamp>00:04:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Don't tell my wife. I'm kidding!
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>She knows. She's a cow!
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>And I only kiss her.
<subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:35</timestamp>
<p>Okay, very good.
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>Haven't you lived in America for 30 years?
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>Ignore him. Why are you
sweating bullets and/or nets?
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>Because there is a restaurant critic
here tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>Very interesting.
</p><timestamp>00:04:50</timestamp>
<p>Critics are the worst.
That's my review of critics.
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>Two thumbs down! Four percent fresh!
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>One star! You all eat a flat butt!
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>Did you not know there was a critic here?
You own this place.
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>I never see you do anything
to help run it.
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>This place runs itself. Right, Sandro?
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>My wife and children and therapy man
may not agree so much,
but if you say so, <i>Signore </i>Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>Even his wife and kids
and therapy man agree.
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>Well, as the Black Guy Pete say,
"Tonight's gonna be a good night."
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>Please. Enjoy.
</p><timestamp>00:05:19</timestamp>
<p>I know you're not happy about
what happened with the Kelsey project.
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>I pushed a little too hard to get you
the money you deserve.
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>What can I say? Sometimes I'm too good
of an agent, so deals fall apart.
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>That's a thing that happens
when agents are really good.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>- That's not--
- Moving forward!
</p><timestamp>00:05:34</timestamp>
<p>I know you're not happy
with how I handled <i>Ethan Around.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>- Or didn't handle it.
- Bygones!
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>It was because I was busy
getting you the <i>Pegasus </i>movie,
which I know you did not get,
but trust me,
you'll see not getting these movies was
the best thing that ever happened to you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>Onwards and upwards!
Tally ho! To the stars!
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>Okay, you're forcing me to use the cards.
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>"Princess Carolyn, clear throat,
I have been very disappointed--"
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>Ring! Hello, Your Highness.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>It's a king, I have to take this.
In the bathroom.
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh, fish, oh, fish!
</p><timestamp>00:06:07</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>woman</subtitle> Who's out there?
Are you talking to me?
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>No.
<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>All right, Pink Lady, think.
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>woman</subtitle> Are you talking to me?
- Are you a pink lady?
</p><timestamp>00:06:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>woman</subtitle> I was a Pink Lady in my high
school's production of <i>Grease.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>- Were you Rizzo?
- <subtitle>woman</subtitle> No, Jan.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>Then don't waste my time.
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>Now, let us bow our heads and bray.
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all bray</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>whispers</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>
<p>Yes, right away!
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>So back to what you were--
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>- Oh, my goodness, what is this?
- Yeah, what is this?
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p><i>Happy 23 years working together</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p><i>- Join me</i>
- Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p><i>- Twenty-two-three, 23 years</i>
<i>- Twenty-three years</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:00</timestamp>
<p>You're making this up.
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p><i>Happy 23 years working together</i>
<i>Can you believe this?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p><i>- Two plus three equals 23</i>
- This is just stream of consciousness.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p><i>Twenty-three years working together!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:09</timestamp>
<p><i>Twenty-three years</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:13</timestamp>
<p>Okay, cool.
</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>Can you believe it, BoJack?
It's been almost a quarter of a century.
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p>Talking on the phone
pretty much every day,
sharing our deepest dreams and secrets,
being there for each other
through all of it, bosom friends,
</p><timestamp>00:07:27</timestamp>
<p><i>Anne of Green Gables</i> style.
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>Let's toast to another 23 years.
What do you say?
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>- You're fired.
- Uh-- Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>I can't believe this. You're firing me?
</p><timestamp>00:07:36</timestamp>
<p>- Me?
- What? No.
</p><timestamp>00:07:38</timestamp>
<p>You have no idea,
everything I do around here!
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>- Half the kitchen staff is my family.
- No.
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>- Honestly, just--
- I detest you!
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>I hope you rot in the hell!
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>- We're headed down a road that--
- You washed-up has-been no-good joke!
</p><timestamp>00:07:51</timestamp>
<p>You are the opposite of an onion,
because if I cut you, I am no gonna cry.
</p><timestamp>00:07:57</timestamp>
<p>Well, now you are fired.
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>Good luck finding another charming
first-generation Italian immigrant
with this kind of darling accent,
who makes equally delightful malapropisms!
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>You, sir, have just cut off your nose
and thrown Sprite in your face!
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>I am a classic stereotype
that is tough to come by nowadays,
because Italians don't emigrate
so much to America no more.
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>Botticelli, Barbarelli, Beetle Bailey!
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>Modigliani, Masaccio, Marmaduke!
</p><timestamp>00:08:26</timestamp>
<p><i>Avanti,</i> all of you! <i>Andiamo!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs nervously</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>So that was weird, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>Please stop looking at me.
</p><timestamp>00:08:36</timestamp>
<p>Too bad about Sandro, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>You're the one who's fired, obviously.
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>Right.
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>Ryan Murphy is doing a re-imagining
of <i>The Life and Times of Harriet Tubman.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>But in this version, she's a tub-man,
with the comparative strength
and agility of a tub!
</p><timestamp>00:08:53</timestamp>
<p>- PC.
- He's looking for someone
to play the Underground
Railroad conductor.
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>Great, but you don't represent me anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I get it. I'm fired.
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>You're gonna spend a couple of days
being mad at me,
then I'll get you another gig, and you'll
be my client again, just like every time.
</p><timestamp>00:09:08</timestamp>
<p>Can we get past the part
where you're mad at me
and get to the part where
you're stealing General Lee's plutonium
to fuel your subterranean
steam-punk slave-tram?
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>"It's best, for both of us,
if we end this relationship
once and for all."
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry I screwed up,
you don't have to read off the--
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>"You take me for granted, made decisions
that were against my wishes,
and worst of all
she's got my globes a-warming!"
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>- How did that get in there?
- What is that?
</p><timestamp>00:09:34</timestamp>
<p>A punch line to a joke
from the roast of January Jones.
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>- A global warming joke?
- It's an important issue. Here we go.
</p><timestamp>00:09:39</timestamp>
<p>"Our relationship no longer has any--"
</p><timestamp>00:09:41</timestamp>
<p>"January has only gotten hotter and hot--"
Nope.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>- Were you at the roast of January Jones?
- No, but I wrote some jokes
in case someone got sick
and they needed a backup.
</p><timestamp>00:09:49</timestamp>
<p>Do you even know January Jones?
Why would they call you?
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>I guess I thought that my agent could
get me in the mix if Jason Sudeikis--
</p><timestamp>00:09:56</timestamp>
<p>How did these get out of order?
</p><timestamp>00:09:58</timestamp>
<p>So in the joke,
are the globes your balls?
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>And they get warm
when you see January Jones?
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>Is that how balls work?
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. It's a work in progress.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>Professional integrity!
</p><timestamp>00:10:07</timestamp>
<p>"Our relationship no longer
has any professional integrity.
</p><timestamp>00:10:10</timestamp>
<p>So it's gotta end. Stand to leave."
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>Shouldn't have read that part.
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>"When you reflect on this,
you'll see it's best for us.
</p><timestamp>00:10:17</timestamp>
<p>Exit restaurant." Goddamn it.
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>Wow, that was--
I don't know what that was.
</p><timestamp>00:10:22</timestamp>
<p>Hey! Where are you going?
</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p>- Who gave you this idea? Spanakopita?
- This has nothing to do with Ana.
</p><timestamp>00:10:29</timestamp>
<p>Here you go, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:10:31</timestamp>
<p>- I'll get it!
- You two are b'thumping.
</p><timestamp>00:10:33</timestamp>
<p>Now you do whatever she says?
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>- Is that what's happening?
- No.
</p><timestamp>00:10:36</timestamp>
<p>No, you're not b'thumping or no,
you're not doing whatever she says?
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p>- I'm not doing whatever she says.
- So you <i>are </i>b'thumping.
</p><timestamp>00:10:42</timestamp>
<p>I understand from context what you mean,
but there's no way b'thumping is a thing.
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>I'll get it!
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>You don't have to do everything
your little falafel pocket tells you to.
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>- You screwed up!
- Once! In 23 years!
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>I'll get 'em.
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>All these years I carried you,
when no one wanted to work with you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:58</timestamp>
<p>I still managed to get you jobs.
</p><timestamp>00:11:00</timestamp>
<p>And then you would flake,
or sabotage them,
or get wrapped up in some crisis
or emergency or vague sadness.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>Everyone told me to dump you--
my bosses, film execs, directors,
they all told me you were washed up,
a nobody, a has-been,
</p><timestamp>00:11:12</timestamp>
<p>- a joke, too portly for TV.
- Too portly for TV? Who said that?
</p><timestamp>00:11:15</timestamp>
<p>- It doesn't matter.
- It does. Who said it?
</p><timestamp>00:11:17</timestamp>
<p>- Luis Guzman.
- Luis Guzman said I'm too portly for TV?
</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>
<p>You're right, BoJack.
This is for the best.
</p><timestamp>00:11:24</timestamp>
<p>I no longer have to lug your talentless,
self-centered, self-sabotaging,
dead-weight carcass
of faded talent around my neck.
</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>- Hey.
- Thank you for firing me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna go pour myself
a little celebratory potato juice,
because this is the best goddamn
thing that's ever happened to me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>Hey! Hey! Hey!
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p>Ha ha! I'll get it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>You do not talk to me like that
and walk away.
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no? What's happening?
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>This is so weird. I'm walking away,
even though you told me not to.
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>Right, I don't work for you anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>- Hey!
- Excuse me, Mr. Horseman?
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p>- Not now.
- We have a slight problem in the kitchen.
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>- Where is everybody?
- That's the problem. They all quit.
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>The kitchen's backed up with orders.
No one's getting food.
</p><timestamp>00:12:04</timestamp>
<p>And the critic is growing very impatient.
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>Writing that down...
</p><timestamp>00:12:10</timestamp>
<p>- Just do what you normally do.
- But there's no chef.
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>Tonight's your lucky night.
You just got promoted.
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>But I don't want to be a chef.
<i>I want to sing</i>
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>Kidding. I'm actually just happy
being a waiter. I'm not my job.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>- A lot of people think that--
- You're the chef! Start cheffing!
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>What? Fifty teeth?
Get out of here. Let me see.
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p>Would you look at that.
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>You're thrilled
to have me out of your life?
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p>- I was such a burden all those years.
- Can I close my mouth now?
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>- Know what I think?
- Don't wanna hear it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p>You like being there to rescue me.
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>- I close my mouth, okay?
- Nobody cares!
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>- Okay--
- Nope, I'm still counting.
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>You like it when I'm a mess.
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>Because it makes you feel good
about yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>Guess what? I never asked for that.
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p>You ask all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>You have never not been asking me
to rescue you.
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>"Princess Carolyn, help me!
</p><timestamp>00:13:03</timestamp>
<p>I slept with the gaffer's wife
and now he's not lighting me properly.
</p><timestamp>00:13:06</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn, I threw up
on Elle Fanning in a bounce house.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn,
why am I such a big stupid asshole?"
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>Okay, great, more abuse.
Right on schedule.
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's abuse?
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>"BoJack, you're such
a big, stupid asshole.
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, why were you even
in the bounce house, dummy?
</p><timestamp>00:13:21</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, you wasted my thirties!"
</p><timestamp>00:13:24</timestamp>
<p>I never said you wasted my thirties.
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>Didn't have to, you're always saying it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>And I don't like being around you,
because I feel bad.
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>You make me feel bad.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>So this isn't about me being a bad agent.
</p><timestamp>00:13:38</timestamp>
<p>It's about a lot of things.
</p><timestamp>00:13:40</timestamp>
<p>- Where are you going?
- Away.
</p><timestamp>00:13:43</timestamp>
<p>Hey, listen, man.
</p><timestamp>00:13:44</timestamp>
<p>I don't wanna get in the middle of this,
it's none of my business,
but I just have to say
I love that sweater.
</p><timestamp>00:13:50</timestamp>
<p>- Can you give it to me?
- What? No.
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p>I held my mouth open a really long time.
</p><timestamp>00:13:54</timestamp>
<p>- What does that have to do--?
- You're not being fair,
to me or Princess Katniss.
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>- Who?
- Your friend.
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>You've forgotten her already?
Typical BoSchwack.
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>That's enough out of you.
</p><timestamp>00:14:05</timestamp>
<p>It's all right,
you're gonna get through this.
</p><timestamp>00:14:07</timestamp>
<p>- You're gonna get through this.
- <subtitle>woman</subtitle> Are you okay?
</p><timestamp>00:14:09</timestamp>
<p>Are you okay?
You've been in there a long time.
</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>woman</subtitle> I left for a while and came back.
</p><timestamp>00:14:14</timestamp>
<p>Just so you know,
this wasn't an easy decision.
</p><timestamp>00:14:17</timestamp>
<p>- This is the ladies' room!
- <subtitle>woman</subtitle> What's going on out there?
</p><timestamp>00:14:19</timestamp>
<p>Are you watching a movie?
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>I agonized over this. Ask Ana.
</p><timestamp>00:14:23</timestamp>
<p>- So you did talk about it with Ana.
- Yeah. I respect her opinion.
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>shouts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:31</timestamp>
<p>Paws not claws! Paws not claws!
</p><timestamp>00:14:33</timestamp>
<p>God, you're strong.
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>This is exactly the kind of
unprofessionalism I'm talking about.
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>- You want to talk about professionalism?
- Yes, I do.
</p><timestamp>00:14:54</timestamp>
<p>But not here.
</p><timestamp>00:14:58</timestamp>
<p>You say you want professionalism?
Bullshit.
</p><timestamp>00:15:01</timestamp>
<p>You want a mommy
you can slide your dick in.
</p><timestamp>00:15:04</timestamp>
<p>I can want that
and also want professionalism.
</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>A sex-mommy who keeps her boundaries,
is that too much to ask?
</p><timestamp>00:15:09</timestamp>
<p>Is there a single woman
you've worked with
who you haven't tried
to groggily thrust yourself into?
</p><timestamp>00:15:14</timestamp>
<p>Is it any wonder
I don't want to be around you?
</p><timestamp>00:15:17</timestamp>
<p>All you do is tell me
I'm a terrible person.
</p><timestamp>00:15:20</timestamp>
<p>Please, you're such
a self-pitying masochist,
</p><timestamp>00:15:23</timestamp>
<p>I could say ten nice things
and one mean thing,
you would only hear the one mean thing.
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>I'd love it
if you said ten nice things to me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>- I can say nice things.
- Ready when you are.
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>Does self-pitying masochist count,
or are we starting from scratch?
</p><timestamp>00:15:35</timestamp>
<p>Okay, one-- I'm freezing my whiskers off.
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>
<p>- You have a natural charisma.
- You hesitated, that means it's a lie.
</p><timestamp>00:15:41</timestamp>
<p>Two, you are loved by millions.
</p><timestamp>00:15:43</timestamp>
<p>That's not a compliment.
So is Kim Jong Un and Teri Hatcher.
</p><timestamp>00:15:46</timestamp>
<p>I got this. I got this.
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p>Pre-heat oven?
Where's the pre-heat button?
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me? Waiter?
</p><timestamp>00:15:52</timestamp>
<p>Where are my family's
double-fudge cheese pies?
</p><timestamp>00:15:54</timestamp>
<p>I'm not your waiter anymore.
I'm the chef.
</p><timestamp>00:15:56</timestamp>
<p>- Then who's our waiter?
- You're the waiter now.
</p><timestamp>00:16:00</timestamp>
<p>I can't be a waiter.
</p><timestamp>00:16:02</timestamp>
<p>I have a very important
business meeting tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:16:04</timestamp>
<p>You get someone else to do it.
I'm the chef and whatever I say goes!
</p><timestamp>00:16:08</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Who gets these
soy balls and onion cubes?
</p><timestamp>00:16:10</timestamp>
<p>Table eight.
Deliver those soy balls, soldier.
</p><timestamp>00:16:12</timestamp>
<p>You got it, boss.
</p><timestamp>00:16:14</timestamp>
<p>Number six.
You know how to make me laugh.
</p><timestamp>00:16:16</timestamp>
<p>So I'm a clown to you?
Like Joe Pesci in <i>Home Alone?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> You recognize
you're being impossible, right?
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>- I don't know how you put up with me.
- I didn't put up with you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:26</timestamp>
<p>I liked being with you.
And I don't regret it.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.
</p><timestamp>00:16:32</timestamp>
<p>Or the bracelet you bought me
for my 38th birthday.
</p><timestamp>00:16:35</timestamp>
<p>Or when my dad died
and you came to the funeral
with me and held my hand.
</p><timestamp>00:16:39</timestamp>
<p>I'm doing this for both of us.
You understand?
</p><timestamp>00:16:42</timestamp>
<p>- Did you ever love me? At all?
- I don't-- I'm not--
</p><timestamp>00:16:46</timestamp>
<p>You know that I don't do
the whole love thing.
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>Either you end up hurting someone
or they hurt you. So, what's the point?
</p><timestamp>00:16:55</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:16:57</timestamp>
<p>This sucks.
</p><timestamp>00:16:59</timestamp>
<p>I did this to myself. I do this to myself.
</p><timestamp>00:17:02</timestamp>
<p>- Why do I do this to myself?
- I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:17:04</timestamp>
<p>Maybe if you're good at putting out fires,
you just run from fire to fire
and don't really think about--
</p><timestamp>00:17:08</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>screams</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:09</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God, I don't wanna be a chef!
I want to be not on fire!
</p><timestamp>00:17:13</timestamp>
<p>- We gotta put out that fire!
- I hate Mondays!
</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>I figured out how to pre-heat the oven.
</p><timestamp>00:17:22</timestamp>
<p>This night has been a disaster.
</p><timestamp>00:17:24</timestamp>
<p>The good news is I got my kid
to prep my important meeting at work.
</p><timestamp>00:17:27</timestamp>
<p>The bad news is
all the customers went home.
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>They didn't like the screaming
and felt like their food
was a little too "on fire".
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>- It's called a char, dumbshits.
- The critic's still here.
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, oh, oh!
</p><timestamp>00:17:39</timestamp>
<p>She still wants her mushroom risotto.
</p><timestamp>00:17:43</timestamp>
<p>I don't know how to make risotto.
</p><timestamp>00:17:45</timestamp>
<p>I know how.
</p><timestamp>00:17:46</timestamp>
<p>What are you doing? No, go home.
</p><timestamp>00:17:48</timestamp>
<p>You're right. What am I doing?
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>All right.
</p><timestamp>00:17:55</timestamp>
<p>Good luck.

<p>Goddamn it.
</p><timestamp>00:18:31</timestamp>
<p>How should I know?
Do I look like an expert in cooking oils?
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>We have to choose!
We're running out of time.
</p><timestamp>00:18:37</timestamp>
<p>- Olive. You wanna use olive oil.
- What are you doing?
</p><timestamp>00:18:40</timestamp>
<p>Let me do this.
You'll burn the place to the ground.
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>Fine. This isn't one of those things
where you save my ass
so I feel obligated to give you
your job back.
</p><timestamp>00:18:48</timestamp>
<p>I know you have no sense
of obligation to me.
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, slam. I'm sorry,
I'd rather not get involved.
</p><timestamp>00:18:55</timestamp>
<p>Can I get you some more water?
</p><timestamp>00:18:57</timestamp>
<p>You look lovely. It's a great blouse.
</p><timestamp>00:18:59</timestamp>
<p>Mom, I wanna go home.
</p><timestamp>00:19:01</timestamp>
<p>This is a very important night
for the restaurant.
</p><timestamp>00:19:03</timestamp>
<p>How are we coming on the sales meeting?
Did you get the big conference room?
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p>Winslow wants the big conference room
for his presentation to corporate.
</p><timestamp>00:19:11</timestamp>
<p>You get back on that phone
and you get me that big room.
</p><timestamp>00:19:14</timestamp>
<p>Okay, Mom.
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>
<p>The secret is stirring continuously.
</p><timestamp>00:19:19</timestamp>
<p>Right, so that's the secret.
</p><timestamp>00:19:22</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna go roll some more soy balls.
</p><timestamp>00:19:26</timestamp>
<p>- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:19:28</timestamp>
<p>How do you know how to do this?
</p><timestamp>00:19:30</timestamp>
<p>Mom was a live-in maid for a rich family.
</p><timestamp>00:19:32</timestamp>
<p>She had a little trouble
bending her elbow too much.
</p><timestamp>00:19:35</timestamp>
<p>Unless I wanted us to be on the street,
I had to cover for her, a lot.
</p><timestamp>00:19:40</timestamp>
<p>That rich family loved Italian food
and champagne fountains.
</p><timestamp>00:19:43</timestamp>
<p>And cocaine. And private jets.
And screaming at each other.
</p><timestamp>00:19:47</timestamp>
<p>"Who threw my cocaine
in the champagne fountain?"
</p><timestamp>00:19:49</timestamp>
<p>- So standard rich people stuff?
- I guess.
</p><timestamp>00:19:53</timestamp>
<p>- How come you never told me that?
- I did.
</p><timestamp>00:19:56</timestamp>
<p>It's okay. I know
you never remember anything.
</p><timestamp>00:19:58</timestamp>
<p>That's not true.
I remember the first time we met.
</p><timestamp>00:20:01</timestamp>
<p>I went to see Marv. You were
at the desk in front of his office.
</p><timestamp>00:20:05</timestamp>
<p>I thought you were cute and you said,
"It's good to see you again."
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p>- So I guess we'd met before.
- That was the third time we met.
</p><timestamp>00:20:13</timestamp>
<p>The first time was when I was an intern.
I delivered a script to your house.
</p><timestamp>00:20:18</timestamp>
<p>You were passed out in the yard,
covered in tapioca pudding.
</p><timestamp>00:20:21</timestamp>
<p>I hosed you down, dragged you inside,
covered you with a blanket.
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>- Really? I don't remember that.
- Shocker.
</p><timestamp>00:20:26</timestamp>
<p>So you've gone from daughter of a maid
to head of your own company.
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p>The company's not doing so hot.
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>- Don't try to guilt me.
- It's not your fault.
</p><timestamp>00:20:34</timestamp>
<p>Turns out being an agent and running
an agency are two different skills.
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>It's like asking a really delicious tomato
to make you a tomato sandwich.
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>How's a tomato gonna make you
a sandwich? He's got no arms.
</p><timestamp>00:20:44</timestamp>
<p>You'll figure it out. Princess Carolyn
always lands on her feet.
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>But I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Does any of it matter?
</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>Why are you an agent at all
if it makes you so miserable?
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>Because I'm good at it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.
But, usually, I'm really good at it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>Just 'cause you're good at something
doesn't mean you have to do it.
</p><timestamp>00:21:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm good at driving sober,
but I don't relish the opportunity.
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>But what else would I do?
Who else would I be?
</p><timestamp>00:21:09</timestamp>
<p>I do love you, by the way.
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>I mean, as much
as I'm capable of loving anyone.
</p><timestamp>00:21:15</timestamp>
<p>Which is never enough. I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:21:23</timestamp>
<p>Ta-da!
</p><timestamp>00:21:27</timestamp>
<p>Well, it is truly...
how should I put this? Wonderful.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>So you'll give Elefante a good review?
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>No, I can't do that.
I waited over two hours to be served.
</p><timestamp>00:21:44</timestamp>
<p>The ambience was terrible.
You two were screaming all night.
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>At one point, a waiter
ran through the restaurant on fire.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>Unfortunately,
you will be receiving my lowest rating:
four hundred and twelve stars,
out of a possible a billion.
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>
<p>A billion stars?
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>Yes, that's the rubric I use on
SamanthaGoesToRestaurants.tumblr.com.
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God, get out.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>I assure you the animated GIFs
with which I describe this encounter
shall be scathing.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>Mom! I just touched base
with Rooney, re: Winslow.
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>He's out, we're in.
The conference room is ours.
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>Perfect! This is the meeting
where we finally convince the big boys
to let us get babies addicted to vaping!
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>Yes! Corporation!
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all cheer</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>- How about a drink?
- I could drink.
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>I don't think I can. I'm heading out.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>I got pretty badly burnt earlier
and in a lot of pain.
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>I should probably go to the ER.
Have a great night.
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p>What's the second time we met?
</p><timestamp>00:22:50</timestamp>
<p>- A taping of <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
- Which episode?
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>The one where Olivia put too much
detergent in the washing machine.
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah.
Nancy Reagan was the guest star.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>That woman
was the real actor in the family.
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>I had just started working for Marv.
I went backstage to introduce myself.
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>And then what happened?
</p><timestamp>00:23:07</timestamp>
<p>You told me you were too tired
pretending to be nice all night,
and to leave you alone.
</p><timestamp>00:23:13</timestamp>
<p>I'm a real jerk, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but you're honest,
straightforward,
not fake nice
and don't beat around the bush.
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>Your heart is tender,
so you protect it from people,
but sometimes you open up a wall
and it's incredible.
</p><timestamp>00:23:26</timestamp>
<p>You're doing the best you can,
considering your asshole parents.
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p>You have great taste in art,
and that pink spot
on your nose is just adorable.
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>How many nice things was that,
about ten?
</p><timestamp>00:23:36</timestamp>
<p>- Just about.
- Okay, one more.
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>You let me help you tonight
because you knew I needed it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>You did it for me,
which was very sweet.
</p><timestamp>00:23:44</timestamp>
<p>Thanks. You're a good friend to me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:48</timestamp>
<p>- BoJack...
- Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>Are we friends?
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I think we are.
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p>Or I think we can be.
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>Okay, then as a friend, I'm asking you...
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>Please don't leave me.
</p><timestamp>00:24:01</timestamp>
<p>- Princess Carolyn--
- Please.
</p><timestamp>00:24:03</timestamp>
<p>I can turn this around,
I just need more time.
</p><timestamp>00:24:06</timestamp>
<p>We're in a fragile period,
still finding our feet.
</p><timestamp>00:24:08</timestamp>
<p>Just give me six months
and then you can go.
</p><timestamp>00:24:11</timestamp>
<p>I promise,
I'll never ask anything from you again,
but please, give me six months.
</p><timestamp>00:24:17</timestamp>
<p>Sorry, I left my coat here.
</p><timestamp>00:24:19</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>whistles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>waiter</subtitle> I got it.
</p><timestamp>00:24:33</timestamp>
<p>So? What do you think?
</p><timestamp>00:24:37</timestamp>
<p>No.
