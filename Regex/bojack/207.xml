</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>No, no, no, no.
It's because we're on a show
called <i>Party of Five. </i>Get it?
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>Hey, buddy,
pass me that bottle of vodka?
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>-That's not really how this works.
-It's open bar, don't be a dick.
</p><timestamp>00:01:21</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack Horseman?
-Do I know you?
</p><timestamp>00:01:23</timestamp>
<p>This is my better half,
Katrina Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:01:26</timestamp>
<p>-Katrina, BoJack.
-I don't watch TV.
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>Can I get another drink now or
will that quote, unquote "embarrass" you?
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>-Uh, uh, no, I would never be--
-Erica! Throw me a raft. I'm dying.
</p><timestamp>00:01:36</timestamp>
<p>My friends told me to get
a prenup,
but I was like,
"Hey, marriage lasts forever."
</p><timestamp>00:01:42</timestamp>
<p>Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.
</p><timestamp>00:01:44</timestamp>
<p>Can you believe two guys like us
were even in the same category
as Hank Hippopopalous?
</p><timestamp>00:01:50</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> That's Uncle Hanky.
</p><timestamp>00:01:51</timestamp>
<p>Listen, Peanutbottle,
there is no "guys like us."
</p><timestamp>00:01:54</timestamp>
<p>I'm BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:01:56</timestamp>
<p>You're just some other guy
I'll probably never talk to again.
</p><timestamp>00:01:58</timestamp>
<p>Hey, boys.
What is this, a crossover episode?
</p><timestamp>00:02:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all laugh</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:03</timestamp>
<p>That is the funniest thing
I have ever heard.
</p><timestamp>00:02:06</timestamp>
<p>Uncle Hanky.
Sir, I am your biggest fan.
</p><timestamp>00:02:09</timestamp>
<p>I used to watch <i>Hank Hippopopalous's</i>
<i>Dance-Pop Cosmopolis</i>
every day after school.
</p><timestamp>00:02:14</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, can I get a picture with you?
-Of course, kid.
</p><timestamp>00:02:17</timestamp>
<p>Here, let me advance this. <subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
And we probably got it.
</p><timestamp>00:02:21</timestamp>
<p>And we'll find out
in four to six weeks.
</p><timestamp>00:02:23</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I can't wait.
</p><timestamp>00:02:24</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I gotta go.
My wife's hand just disappeared
into that busboy's pants.
</p><timestamp>00:02:28</timestamp>
<p>Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.
</p><timestamp>00:02:31</timestamp>
<p>Hey, kid, listen.
</p><timestamp>00:02:33</timestamp>
<p>Don't beat yourself up too bad.
</p><timestamp>00:02:34</timestamp>
<p>I've seen your show. You're really funny.
</p><timestamp>00:02:37</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah?
-Yeah. But I'm Uncle Hanky.
</p><timestamp>00:02:40</timestamp>
<p>You can't beat Uncle Hanky.
</p><timestamp>00:02:42</timestamp>
<p>That's just the way it is.
</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>Oh.

<p>-Diane!
-<subtitle>passenger</subtitle> Aah!
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>Will you bring me one of those
big Toblerone bars? <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:57</timestamp>
<p>Well, sure. But, you know, I won't
be out there for another month.
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>Yes, I know, but I always forget to
write these things down.
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>Tell me, how's your little movie?
</p><timestamp>00:04:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Actually one of the stars just died.
It's really sad.
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>Oh, really? One person died? Just one?
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>Yeah, well, that's a real tragedy.</i>
<i>Meanwhile, Diane,</i>
here in Cordovia, I'm stitching
children's arms back on.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's backwards, isn't it?
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Are you giving me a thumb's up
or a thumb's down? I can't tell.
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, now the production's
on hiatus
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so BoJack and I
are going on a book tour
to promote the new paperback edition
of <i>One Trick Pony.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>Please get here soon, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>The people of Cordovia need you
and I need that Toblerone.
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>Okay, listen, you big dummy.
</p><timestamp>00:04:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You need to be on
your best behavior for this tour.
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Don't do that BoJack thing
where you go off-script
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and get a lot of people
mad at you.
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What? I don't do that.
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You're a movie star now.
</p><timestamp>00:04:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Any bad press you get
can hurt <i>Secretariat.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p><i>Now boarding, Flight 422 to Juneau.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>Please. We're going to Alaska.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}How am I gonna offend a bunch
of inbred Eskimo blubber-munchers?
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You're right. What was I thinking?

</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>-Mm.
-<subtitle>Wanda</subtitle> Why don't we get Hank in here?
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>You guys can get
some pictures together.
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>Hank is coming here?
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p>That old guy from
<i>Hey, I Think You Can Dance?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>-What's the big deal?
-You don't understand.
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>When I was a kid,
this guy was <i>the</i> guy.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>I even bought his novelty rap album,
<i>The Hank Hippopopalous Hip-Hop Hypothesis.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>You shouldn't meet your hero
on an empty stomach.
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>-Want me to go get you some chili?
-Good call.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>Chili is nature's chillaxative.
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>Hiya, folks! Howdy!
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Hank Hippopopalous.
-Oh, we've met.
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>Oh, oh, yeah. I remember that.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so, I thought for the ad,
you guys could stand back to back.
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>And then on the billboard it'll say:
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"Hank and Mr. Peanutbutter are back
to back. Thursdays on MBN." <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So, what should I do with my arms?
Like akimbo?
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-You're fine.
-Reverse akimbo?
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-No, that--
-King Tut? Mashed Potato? Windmill?
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Uh-oh, I'm windmilling.
Got a momentum going.
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>-Can't stop windmilling now.
-Hey, hey.
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>Why don't we just do
what feels natural?
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>Guys like us? We're pros.
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>"Guys like us"?
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>You think I'm a guy like us?
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my life.
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me,
would you get a picture of us?
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, that's kind of the idea.
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>Now we open the floor to questions
from the audience.
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, your book talked a lot about
how much you love apple fritters.
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>So, my question is:
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p>Do you think Israel
has a right to defend herself?
</p><timestamp>00:06:59</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-And what part should the U.S. play
as an ally?
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, the thing about that...
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>both growl</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Uh... It's a shame that Arafat
walked away from the table in 2000.
</p><timestamp>00:07:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I mean, obviously there's no panacea,
but a two-state solution
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}with an emphasis on human rights
feels like a place to begin.
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>audience murmuring</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-<subtitle>Moose</subtitle> Brilliant insight.
-<subtitle>woman</subtitle> Very good.
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>-My question is for Diane Nyu-- Nyu--
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>- Nyu--
-You won't get it. Ask the question.
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>Your book went to some revealing places.
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>Were you worried at all that it
would hurt BoJack or his career?
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>That's a great question.
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>I'd also like to know
the answer to that, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>Well, I think the truth
is worth pursuing, no matter what.
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>BoJack's not perfect.
There are other celebrities
who have done much worse things
and it hasn't hurt their careers.
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>-Like who?
-I don't know, like Mike Tyson
or... Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin,
or Christian Slater, Woody Allen,
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray...
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>Wait, wait, what about
Hank Hippopopalous?
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>Well, all of his former assistants
have made the same allegations.
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>-I feel like we're getting off track.
-Do you not know that?
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p>Any questions about me,
the handsome, famous horse with a book?
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>What do you have against Uncle Hanky?
</p><timestamp>00:08:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm not saying anything
not on the public record.
</p><timestamp>00:08:08</timestamp>
<p>You can just Google
"Hank Hippopopalous allegations" and I--
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you don't have to
Google it right now.
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>Dear God.
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p>Stanky Hanky?
Allegations vile and ranky.
</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>But first, the visiting
Cordovian Prince Gustav
went missing briefly
this afternoon,
but he was quickly found
buying chili in Beverly Hills.
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>His official statement was,
"Uh, yeah, I'm the Prince of Cordovia.
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>Hooray, being a prince."
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p>Our main story,
ominous and anomalous accusations
against Hank Hippopopalous.
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen
and what does she have against
our beloved hippopotamus?
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>Joining me now is
Hippopopalous apologist
and armchair sociologist,
Cardigan Burke. Cardigan,
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}what are these allegations?
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}These allegations are so crazy,
I can't even say them on TV
</p><timestamp>00:08:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}or I'll sound like a crazy person.
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What I want to know
is why we're letting a national treasure
</p><timestamp>00:08:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}face the same kind of smear tactics
used by the Viet Cong.
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Are you calling attention to the fact
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}that Ms. Nguyen is Vietnamese?
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'd like to think that's a coincidence.

<p><subtitle>Peanutbutter</subtitle> <i>You gotta see</i>

confetti shoots out of the ears,
then I somersault out the mouth.

-I did know that.

<p>So... listen.
Some website called "Tit Puncher"
is saying you said some stuff
about Hank Hippopopalous.
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, Mr. Peanutbutter,
I didn't mean for that to happen.
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>Hey, do me a favor.
Please don't make a big thing out of this.
</p><timestamp>00:09:41</timestamp>
<p>It's really not a good time, you know,
with my show about to launch.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, we are on the same page.
-Oh, are you also on "Tit Puncher"?
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>Because you should not read
the comments.
</p><timestamp>00:09:49</timestamp>
<p>Believe me,
nothing would make me happier
than for this to just go away.
</p><timestamp>00:09:53</timestamp>

<p>Diane,
I believe this question is for you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:42</timestamp>
<p>If anyone here has any questions
about the book,
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>I'd be happy to answer those.
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>As would I, BoJack Horseman,
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>Golden-Globe winning
star of the book.
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>If Hank did anything wrong,
they wouldn't let him on TV, right?
</p><timestamp>00:10:53</timestamp>
<p>I'm really not here
to talk about that.
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>You women are all the same.
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>-Excuse me?
-Yeah, you make these
broad accusations
to get attention for yourself,
and when you don't have proof
to back it up, you just slink away.
</p><timestamp>00:11:04</timestamp>
<p>I'm not slinking away.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>I just wanted to say one thing
about me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>I text and drive like all the time.
What?
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>Isn't that what happened with all
those assistants? They took his money,
and they don't even care
they could be ruining a man's life.
</p><timestamp>00:11:17</timestamp>
<p>What? <i>They</i> ruined <i>his</i> life?
</p><timestamp>00:11:20</timestamp>
<p>-You should probably just drop this.
-Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.
</p><timestamp>00:11:23</timestamp>
<p>They don't even know
how much I'm gonna drop it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:25</timestamp>
<p>The way you said that
made it sound like you won't drop it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}How dare you spread
a narrative that--
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Don't tell me what to spread.
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'll spread whatever I want.
It's called one of the amendments.
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical!
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-This is completely--
-Yeah, hi.
</p><timestamp>00:11:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I came with her. I gotta say
I'm opposed to child labor,
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}like as a rule, but there
are some kinds of labor
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}that children are just better at.
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You ever try to fit
into a mine shaft?
</p><timestamp>00:11:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That is a tight squeeze. What?
</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, man, probably gonna get
some letters about that, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm so incorrigible.
</p><timestamp>00:11:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Everyone's paying attention
to me now!
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.
</p><timestamp>00:12:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Anyone else want a snack?
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No? That's a no?
On the snacks? Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What do you have against
Hank Hippopopalous?
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Everyone says
he's a really nice guy.
</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Good point.
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's exactly the problem.
Because he's so nice,
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}people don't wanna think
he's capable of awful things
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so they let him off the hook.
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We don't know what happened.
It's a classic "he said, she said."
</p><timestamp>00:12:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}"He said, <i>they</i> said."
It's eight different women.
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Are they all lying?
-I mean, probably. We do that.
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}At this point,
we just don't know enough to judge.
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Who are these women?
Have they ever shoplifted perhaps?
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Do they wear short shorts?
</p><timestamp>00:12:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Do they drink alcohol?
All these things are possible.
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We don't know the facts.
</p><timestamp>00:12:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}See, this is part of the problem.
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You're supposed to be a journalist.
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You won't even tell your audience
what he's accused of.
</p><timestamp>00:12:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You're an expert.
Why don't you tell us?
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm not afraid to say it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Eight different women,

</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>What is Diane doing?
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p>I know. It's supposed to be my book tour
and she's upstaging me.
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p>Like how it was supposed
to be my book.
</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>Actually, this might be
a thing she does.
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>She knows that Hippopopalous
is the only thing
keeping my network afloat, right?
</p><timestamp>00:13:05</timestamp>
<p>The same network
that employs her husband.
</p><timestamp>00:13:07</timestamp>
<p>Why would she do this?
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>
<p>Sometimes she just whips
herself into a frenzy
and she loses all perspective.
Goddamn it, honeydew?!
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>Jesus, why does cantaloupe think
every time it gets invited to a party,
it can bring along
its dumb friend honeydew?
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>You don't get a plus-one,
cantaloupe!
</p><timestamp>00:13:20</timestamp>
<p>You need to talk to her.

</p><timestamp>00:13:50</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>Oh, don't worry about it.

</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:14:58</timestamp>
<p>The pleasure's yours.
Walk with me, squawk with me.

<p>That woman can knock a drink back like
a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy,

</p><timestamp>00:15:06</timestamp>
<p>No. Yes. Turtleneck. You're fired.
</p><timestamp>00:15:09</timestamp>
<p>Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you
an exposé on Hank Hippopopalous.
</p><timestamp>00:15:12</timestamp>
<p>I would love
to take down Hippopopalous
and finally topple the acropolis
of monstrous hypocrisy
that ensconces us.
</p><timestamp>00:15:18</timestamp>
<p>Hey, wouldn't your readers
prefer something more relevant?
</p><timestamp>00:15:21</timestamp>
<p>Like, uh, what to do with all those
extra buttons that come with your shirts.
</p><timestamp>00:15:25</timestamp>
<p>Amanda, I am so glad you're throwing
your weight behind this.
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, I didn't mean--
-That dress is hideous.
</p><timestamp>00:15:31</timestamp>
<p>Go home, burn it and come back.
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p>When we know what we know
about a monster like that
and we still put him on TV
every week,
we're teaching a generation
of young boys and girls
that a man's reputation
is more important
than the lives of the women
he's ruined.
</p><timestamp>00:15:43</timestamp>
<p>Yes, exactly!
I feel like I've been alone
in a crazy alternate universe
these last few days.
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p>Well, you know I got your back,

<p>No, people don't want articles

</p><timestamp>00:15:55</timestamp>
<p>Diane, you need to be strong.
</p><timestamp>00:15:57</timestamp>
<p>Everyone is gunning for you. You're
a woman talking out of turn about a man.
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p>We're not supposed to have opinions.
We're supposed to smile and look pretty.
</p><timestamp>00:16:05</timestamp>
<p>No, this model doesn't look as pretty

</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>

<p>I didn't do any of those things

<p>I wanna be very clear.
</p><timestamp>00:17:39</timestamp>
<p>I'm not meeting you here

<p>This is me doing you a favor.
</p><timestamp>00:17:43</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:18:32</timestamp>
<p>There's gotta be someone
who will talk.
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>Oh, listen. I had a conversation
with my bosses
at AOL-Time Warner-Pepsico-
Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-

<p>Toyota-Trader Joe's,

these kind of stories,

<p>-Are you seriously killing this?
-It's just not a good time.
</p><timestamp>00:18:49</timestamp>
<p>So, this has nothing to do
with the fact
that AOL-Time Warner-Pepsico-

<p>Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-
Trader Joe's also owns MBN,

<p>No, I don't want a Joe-Joe.

by attacking a famous man, is that it?
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>Uh, what? No.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>-Eat shit, Diane!
-You eat shit!
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>Diane, obviously Todd doesn't know
what you're talking about.
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>He spent the last few days
at Burning Man or whatever getting high.
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>No! That's not what happened at all.
</p><timestamp>00:21:06</timestamp>
<p>A stranger just told me to eat shit.
</p><timestamp>00:21:09</timestamp>
<p>I don't understand why you
can't be on my side about this.
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>
<p>I am on your side.
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>And I'm telling you
you're not gonna win this thing.
</p><timestamp>00:21:15</timestamp>
<p>Also, P.S., when have you ever
been on my side?
</p><timestamp>00:21:18</timestamp>
<p>-I am always on your side.
-Really?
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>Like when you wrote that book?
Was that you being on my side?
</p><timestamp>00:21:23</timestamp>
<p>You're not still mad about the book.
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p>You manipulated me
and completely took advantage of--
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>Guys? There is a very fragile alliance
between the Cords and the Ovians.
</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>If we don't do something--
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>-Todd, nobody cares.
-Nobody cares, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>Everything I did
was to help you tell the story
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>I knew you wanted to tell.
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p>You got everything you wanted
because of that book.
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>You were a joke,
now people take you seriously.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>You were out of work,
now you got your dream role.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>Okay, yes. All of that is true.
</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p>But also, you were my friend
and you hurt my feelings.
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>And it's weird that
you never apologized for that...
and that you still won't.
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>Well... <subtitle>quietly</subtitle>
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>-Are you?
-Yes, actually. I am.
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>I didn't want to do that
and I probably could have
handled things better.
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>I definitely should have.
I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:22:17</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>But this is bigger than you and me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:19</timestamp>
<p>And I need you in my corner now
because I don't have anybody else.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>Well, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:22:27</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:22:30</timestamp>
<p>I'm in your corner.
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>Guys, earlier, some general
asked me if it was "a go"
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>...on "that thing we talked about"?
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>And I said, "Yes." And he said,
"God help us all" and left the room.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>Now I'm not sure
that was the right answer.
</p><timestamp>00:22:48</timestamp>
<p>So, then I called Wayne to see
if I could write a story for <i>Buzzfeed.</i>
Here's the good news:
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p>They'll publish anything.
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>Hey, um...
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
<p>Can I talk to you?
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, of course. What's up?
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>I asked you, really nicely,
not to make a big thing out of this.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, I know, but someone--
-Had to say something, right?
</p><timestamp>00:23:07</timestamp>
<p>And that someone had to be you?
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>Because... why?
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>I really don't get it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p>What is accomplished by you
being the one to take a stand on this?
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter--
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p>This game show
is a really big deal for me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>And I know that sounds
stupid to you, and small.
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>But I need this to go well,
and I can't... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p>Those are death threats.
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>People want to murder my wife
because of what she's
saying on the news
about something that
she has nothing to do with.
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>"You can't. You stupid, ugly can't."
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, that doesn't say "can't."
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:23:44</timestamp>
<p>God, you know, you'd almost
be safer in Cordovia.
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, maybe I should go to Cordovia.
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>I'm obviously not making
a difference here.
</p><timestamp>00:23:53</timestamp>
<p>Actually, maybe you should.
</p><timestamp>00:23:55</timestamp>
<p>Go feel good about yourself
and do your important work.
</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>And maybe some space
might be good for us.
</p><timestamp>00:24:04</timestamp>
<p>You don't really want me to go,
do you?
</p><timestamp>00:24:09</timestamp>
<p>Why does it suddenly matter
what I want?
