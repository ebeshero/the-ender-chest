my old baby blanket, Blinky.
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>I thought you could take it with you.

-No, BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>-No, sorry.
-See? That guy's way too fat to be BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>-I'm not too fat to be BoJack.
-Yeah, BoJack is much fatter, right?
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p>-No, BoJack is not fatter.
-So <i>you're </i>fatter?
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>-No! We are both equally not fat.
-Right.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>You know who looks like BoJack Horseman?
Phil the stock boy.

<p>So you were with Sarah Lynn
when she died, right?
</p><timestamp>00:07:11</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-TMZ said you took her to the hospital.
</p><timestamp>00:07:14</timestamp>
<p>-And you held her hand.
-Did you cry?
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>-I'm not--
-Did she totally poop her pants?
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>I heard people poop their pants
when they die.
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>-Listen to me--
-God, is that true?
</p><timestamp>00:07:21</timestamp>

<p>Hey, Not BoJack, did you hear they're
making a miniseries about Sarah Lynn?
</p><timestamp>00:07:57</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack is being played by Paul Giamatti.
-What?!
</p><timestamp>00:08:00</timestamp>
<p>Why would you get Paul Giamatti
to play me... meaty roles like that one?
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>Hey, buddy, is any of that
to fix the door?
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>-What do you care?
-I don't.
</p><timestamp>00:08:11</timestamp>
<p>And if it were up to me, that old house
would've been torn down years ago.
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>It's a blight on the neighborhood.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>

<p>What kind of a sandwich
has cherries on top?
</p><timestamp>00:08:22</timestamp>

What a pretty girl.
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>-What did they do to you? <subtitle>sobs</subtitle>
-Oh, hush.
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>It's okay. I'm better now.
</p><timestamp>00:23:53</timestamp>
<p>I don't understand.
</p><timestamp>00:23:55</timestamp>
<p>Love does things to a person,
terrible things.

</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>Beatrice, promise me
you'll never love anyone
</p><timestamp>00:24:03</timestamp>
<p>-as much as I loved Crackerjack.
-I promise. I won't.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>Why, I have half a mind...
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>truck advancing, beeping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:16</timestamp>
<p>Keep going, keep going, keep going.
There we go, big boy.
</p><timestamp>00:24:19</timestamp>
<p>Hey, what's going on out here?
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>Probably should have warned you,
when these guys tear the house down
it might make some noise.
</p><timestamp>00:24:25</timestamp>
<p>Tear the <i>house </i>down?!
</p><timestamp>00:24:26</timestamp>
<p>Uh, yeah. You think I just want
to mope around in a shrine to the past,
getting off on my own guilt
while the rest of my life passes me by?
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>Pathetic, much?
</p><timestamp>00:24:33</timestamp>
<p>But we spent the last eight months
restoring this place.
</p><timestamp>00:24:36</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, and then you tried to kill me.
</p><timestamp>00:24:38</timestamp>
<p>That's usually a series wrap
on a friendship.
</p><timestamp>00:24:40</timestamp>
<p>-What is a series wrap?
-Are you serious?
</p><timestamp>00:24:42</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, what am I doing
in this backwash of a town?
</p><timestamp>00:24:45</timestamp>
<p>Do you even get Showtime here?
</p><timestamp>00:24:47</timestamp>
<p>-So what was all this for?
-I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:24:49</timestamp>
<p>Guess it was just a big waste of time.
</p><timestamp>00:24:51</timestamp>
<p>But you can't change the past.
Time's arrow marches on, right?
</p><timestamp>00:24:54</timestamp>
<p>I don't believe this.
</p><timestamp>00:24:55</timestamp>
<p>Well, as a great woman once said,
suck a dick, dumbshit. <subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:25:00</timestamp>
<p>-Where are you going?
-Home.
