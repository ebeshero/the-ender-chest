<p>And that's the end of a sexist,
fatphobic anecdote
in which I was so desperate
to get out of the rain,
</p><timestamp>00:00:14</timestamp>
<p>-I slept with a plus-sized woman.

<p>-Oh! Did I miss a meeting?
-No, Angela.
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>We took Davey here out
for a big '90s-style birthday party,
it being the '90s and all...
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>I would have come!
I love the '90s, and it being them.
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>Come on, the president of the network
shouldn't fraternize with the board.
</p><timestamp>00:00:33</timestamp>
<p>Let your number two handle that stuff.

<p>I don't like you going to birthday parties
behind my back, Teddy.

<p>I was doing reconnaissance for you!
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p>You didn't hear it from me,
but there's some concern
that as a single career gal, you're,
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>-well, a single career gal.
-And?
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>ABC's supposed to be
a family network.
</p><timestamp>00:00:52</timestamp>
<p>I understand families.
</p><timestamp>00:00:54</timestamp>
<p>Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>Does he?

<p>Oh, Herb. <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Herb</subtitle> I'm sorry, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>It's called discretion, Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:01:05</timestamp>
<p>We're trying to sell
the network to Disney.
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p>Disney? You think Michael Eisner
gives a hoot who I go to bed with?
</p><timestamp>00:01:10</timestamp>
<p>We don't need to bring Eisner into this.
</p><timestamp>00:01:12</timestamp>
<p>Obviously,
Michael Eisner is a compassionate
and progressive individual.
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>This isn't about him.
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>-So, it's you. Just say it's you.
-No. You're the one--
</p><timestamp>00:01:20</timestamp>
<p>If you're going to fire me,
at least have the balls to fire me.
</p><timestamp>00:01:23</timestamp>
<p>-You're fired.
-Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>You think you can do
"Horsin' Around" without me?
</p><timestamp>00:01:26</timestamp>
<p>We could do it without anybody.
All we need is the horse.
</p><timestamp>00:01:29</timestamp>
<p>And that horse is just gonna go along
with you canning his best friend?
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>You want BoJack to betray me,
you're gonna need one hell of a pitch.
</p><timestamp>00:01:37</timestamp>

<p>{\an8}-The set of "Horny Unicorn"?
-Yes, I'm aware.

<p>To shoot a scene
in which the titular horny unicorn
gets his penis stuck in a saxophone,

</p><timestamp>00:03:04</timestamp>
<p><i>We met once before.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:09</timestamp>
<p>I remember.
</p><timestamp>00:03:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I saw your interview several months back.
It made me nostalgic.
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>Me too. Nostalgic for the day
before I did the interview.
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yes, humor. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}If you're free tonight, you could come by
the house, watch the fire, reminisce.
</p><timestamp>00:03:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-<i>Wouldn't you love to find out?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So, the Stephen King musical opened
right next door to the Sondheim revival.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We have clients in both.
 I was worried there'd be tension,
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}but it turns out <i>Misery</i> loves <i>Company.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Judah, are you in a band?
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Why do you ask that?
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I've always wondered if you were in a band
ever since this afternoon
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}when I overheard Juniper tell Stuart
that you were in a band.
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>You're playing a gig tonight,
and the whole office is going.
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I was planning to invite you,
but didn't want you to feel obligated.
</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>

<p>You know Teddy Buttons,
my head of production?
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm familiar with Teddy.
</p><timestamp>00:04:03</timestamp>
<p>I somehow missed that Teddy has spent
the last 20 years showing women his...
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>I'm familiar.
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p>See, that's why I love you.
You're discreet.
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>-You're tough. You're Teflon.
-That's me, an old frying pan.
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>I could use someone who can
handle the heat over here.
</p><timestamp>00:04:16</timestamp>
<p>Someone who can be more
professional and less... Moonves.
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p>What are you saying?
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>I want you to run Turteltaub's
new female-focused studio division,
</p><timestamp>00:04:25</timestamp>
<p>-Girtletaub!
-I didn't sneeze.
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>No, Girtletaub is the studio.
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>I wanna announce a slate
before the Teddy story hits the trades.
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>You think you can throw one together?
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>You want me to pitch
my dream movie studio?

<p>Hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>Get me box office numbers.
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>We need firm financial figures to frame
how fans flock
to flicks that flex chicks,
woman films,
like <i>Pretty, Wonder, Little.</i>

<p>Oh, wait! Your gig.
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>I have time. This is important.
<i>When a Man Loves a...</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>

-That's another film title,
as we were discussing previously.
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>Oh, of course.

<p>-Hey, Guy, I'm about to...
<i>-Diane.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>Am I wearing a T-shirt right now that says
"Treat me like I'm some kind of asshole"?
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>I can't see you right now,
but I'm guessing by your tone, no?
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>Then why is my ex-wife treating me
like I'm some kind of asshole?
</p><timestamp>00:05:24</timestamp>
<p>Did you tell her
you weren't wearing the shirt?
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>Lady got a job in Houston.
</p><timestamp>00:05:27</timestamp>
<p>She's taking Sonny out of school
and moving to Texas.
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>She can't do that!
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>Well, she can,
because she has full custody.
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>And this is her dream job, and I'm really
happy for her. But this sucks!
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>Well, they must need cameramen
in Houston, and I can write anywhere...
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p>I... couldn't ask you to do that.
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>I wouldn't ask you to ask.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>If Sonny's going to Houston,
then we're going.
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Okay. All right. Houston.
Uh, g-go, Astros!
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>Go... rodeos!
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>Hope you like barbecue!
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>I hope I don't need another abortion
because they are hard to get there!
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>-Wait, what?
-Just trying to think of Texas things.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>Sorry. Houston!
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>All day at the airport,
I watch people pull suitcases.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>Why do we suffer
that extra weight dragging us down?
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>Because we need clean clothes.
</p><timestamp>00:06:13</timestamp>
<p>The point is: helium luggage.
</p><timestamp>00:06:15</timestamp>
<p>Why pack light
when you can pack lighter than air?
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p>All right, so Mom's too sick
to come out of her room
but not too sick
to make her famous Frito pie?
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p>Well, she wanted to see you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>She was fine all day
and then suddenly ill with a stomach bug.
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>I wanna see her.
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>No, no, no, no, she's not there!
She's at the Zumba.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>Is she at Zumba or is she sick?
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>She is sick but was hoping
the Afro-Latin fusion beats
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>-would make her feel better.
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>Todd, I must confess to you,
your mother is not at Zumba.
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>I can see her in the window.
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>Oh! That's a mannequin
so I can test out my outfits.
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>-You're lying again!
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p>Okay. She didn't come to dinner
because she's ashamed.
</p><timestamp>00:07:00</timestamp>
<p>She can't say hello?
The woman has my kidney!
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>And that's why she's ashamed.
</p><timestamp>00:07:04</timestamp>
<p>A mother shouldn't owe her child her life.
</p><timestamp>00:07:07</timestamp>
<p>If she could turn it around somehow,
save your life...
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>-But, alas, she cannot.
-Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>But maybe if she could...
but no, you’re obviously healthy.

to see me tonight?

<p>Oh, yeah! I had the idea a few months ago,
then one weekend it just fell out of me.
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>-What?
<i>-From the way people talk about writing,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:53</timestamp>
<p>I always assumed it was very difficult,
but it turns out it's not at all,
literally anyone can do it!
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p>Yes, that's always been my experience.
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>I loved your new book, by the way.

</p><timestamp>00:11:01</timestamp>
<p>That's incredible.
</p><timestamp>00:11:02</timestamp>
<p>Too bad no one will ever see it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:04</timestamp>
<p>After your interview,
we couldn't give these things away.
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh, right. Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>It was a great show.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>It would be a shame

the specifics of your dream slate.

</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>My job is to be here when you are.
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>No. Don't give your whole life
to this job,
because if you do, someday someone
will finally ask you what you want
and you'll realize
you don't even know anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.

<p>Gronkle has been re-cutting
old episodes of <i>The Cosby Show</i>
to take out all the Cosby scenes.
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>-They call it "The Show."
-Huh.
</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>They wanna try something similar
with "Horsin' Around."
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p>So, it'll just be "Around"?
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>It'll just be around eight minutes
an episode,
which is perfect
for today's ADD-addled youth.
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>It's about three precocious orphans
living without any adult supervision,
who learn that wisdom and guidance
can be found everywhere.
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>It's all "around."
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>Well, sounds like
you got it all figured out.
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p>-What do you need me for?
-Your backend.
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p>Nobody's going to watch the show
if they think
you're still profiting off it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:44</timestamp>
<p>-I need that money now more than ever.
-We want to buy you out.
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>A one-time payment and then
you're divorced from the show forever.
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:12:56</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>-Why?
-<i>Offensive to Susans.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>There was a protest
organized by Susan Sarandon.
</p><timestamp>00:17:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no!
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>Not that many Susans showed up.

</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>They're lazy?

</p><timestamp>00:17:41</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, I don't know
how we got talking about me for so long.
</p><timestamp>00:17:44</timestamp>
<p>You were gonna tell me
about your boyfriend. It's good?
</p><timestamp>00:17:46</timestamp>
<p>It's really good. When I'm with him,
</p><timestamp>00:17:48</timestamp>
<p>I feel like I'm part of an "us," you know?
</p><timestamp>00:17:50</timestamp>
<p>Like, every other relationship, I always
felt like a "me" in a relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:17:54</timestamp>
<p>Does that make sense?
</p><timestamp>00:17:55</timestamp>
<p>Uh, yeah. That makes sense.
</p><timestamp>00:17:57</timestamp>
<p>Sorry. I-I didn't realize
I was doing that.
</p><timestamp>00:18:00</timestamp>
<p>I've always tried to be
an "us" with people
even when I could see
it wasn't a good idea.
</p><timestamp>00:18:04</timestamp>
<p>Now that I'm single, I feel like
I'm finally learning how to be a "me."
</p><timestamp>00:18:07</timestamp>
<p>That's great.

<p><i>I know there were times you would</i>

</p><timestamp>00:18:20</timestamp>
<p>Tell me what it's like to be Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:18:23</timestamp>
<p>Okay. When you're Diane,
you can live your whole life
like it's a puzzle,
put together
from the pieces of different sets.
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>Like a crossover puzzle?
</p><timestamp>00:18:36</timestamp>
<p>Exactly.
</p><timestamp>00:18:37</timestamp>
<p>Your whole life is full
of these pieces that don't quite fit.
</p><timestamp>00:18:40</timestamp>
<p>Sounds like a hard puzzle.
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>But at some point,
you start to think it's you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p><i>You're the piece that doesn't quite fit.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:18:49</timestamp>
<p><i>And you spend so long with that feeling</i>
<i>that the feeling becomes your home.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:18:55</timestamp>
<p>And it can be jarring
when you discover one day
that you suddenly
don't feel that way anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:19:01</timestamp>
<p>At first, you don't trust it.
</p><timestamp>00:19:03</timestamp>
<p>But then, gradually, you do.
</p><timestamp>00:19:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. That was a weird thing
to be telling my ex-husband.
</p><timestamp>00:19:09</timestamp>
<p>No.

<p>-I'm really happy for you, Diane.

<p>I feel like if we met each other

</p><timestamp>00:20:00</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no, I know you didn't mean to--
</p><timestamp>00:20:02</timestamp>
<p>I thought kicking you out
was the right thing.
</p><timestamp>00:20:05</timestamp>
<p>You were 18.
You had dropped out of high school.
</p><timestamp>00:20:08</timestamp>
<p>You were always high.
You only wore flip-flops.
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p>-You never showered.
-You don't have to list everything.
</p><timestamp>00:20:13</timestamp>
<p>I wanted you to grow up,
not leave forever.
</p><timestamp>00:20:16</timestamp>
<p>Then more and more time passed
and I didn't know how to make it right.
</p><timestamp>00:20:20</timestamp>
<p>Truth is, I did grow up. Your plan worked.
</p><timestamp>00:20:23</timestamp>
<p>I haven't had a mom for so long, I...
I don't really need one anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>Oh. So, what do we do now?
</p><timestamp>00:20:31</timestamp>
<p>Well, I do have one idea.
</p><timestamp>00:20:34</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-A big robot suit like in <i>Aliens,</i>
but for babies
so they can do grown-up things!
</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>-That sounds dangerous.
-Yeah, I guess it is.
</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>But maybe the robots could be powered
by energy generated
from sucking on pacifiers.
</p><timestamp>00:20:51</timestamp>
<p>That is so smart! Babies love sucking
and right now it's just wasted energy!

<p>Well, not all by myself.
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
