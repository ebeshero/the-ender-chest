It's true, that is my name.

<p>-Ah! Boots, leave your sister alone!
-She started it!
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>Well, stop it right now
or I'll pop the both of you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p><i>So, put on those flygirl goggles,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>

<p>How many times

</p><timestamp>00:00:54</timestamp>
<p>When you get me a second tape,
I'll watch something else.

</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Hello?
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>How the hell do they expect me to learn
five pages of dialogue in one day?
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>-What am I, Young Sheldon?
-BoJack--
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>No show should have that much talking.
TV is a visual medium.
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p><i>-Anyway, where the hell are you?</i>
-Eden, North Carolina.
</p><timestamp>00:01:22</timestamp>
<p>Ugh, North Carolina?
That's the second worst of the Carolinas.
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p>-You know I'm from here, right?
-Yeah, and you got out.
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>You know what "from" means?
</p><timestamp>00:01:30</timestamp>
<p>You don't have to be there anymore.
That's why they call it "from."
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I'm about to be
<i>from </i>this conversation.
</p><timestamp>00:01:35</timestamp>
<p>Wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Can we just talk about Mr. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:01:38</timestamp>
<p>Why did you cast him on this show?
Everybody loves him.
</p><timestamp>00:01:40</timestamp>
<p>I'm the guy everybody's supposed to love.
I'm Philbert.
</p><timestamp>00:01:43</timestamp>
<p>-Ugh!
-So then I got a food truck for the crew
with a big sign that said,
"From your favorite star,"
but everybody thought
it was from Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:01:50</timestamp>
<p>They didn't even read the sign.
</p><timestamp>00:01:51</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I'm gonna be back tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:01:53</timestamp>
<p>Do you think you can handle your shit
until then?
</p><timestamp>00:01:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah, that sounds like me.
What are you doing there anyway?
</p><timestamp>00:01:58</timestamp>
<p>Just... taking care of some family stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:02:03</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>series theme music playing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:59</timestamp>
<p>Thanks for coming, all this way.
</p><timestamp>00:03:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-We could've just talked on the phone.
-I wanted to meet you in person.
</p><timestamp>00:03:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's the Princess Carolyn difference.
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ooh! I've never met a person who had
a difference named after them before.
</p><timestamp>00:03:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, this is important.
We're here to talk about your baby.
</p><timestamp>00:03:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I know what you're thinking;
another dumb teenager,
so liquored up, she forgot to make sure
her boyfriend wrapped his tweedle.
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>Well, that's all true,
but I'm not some backwoods hick.
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Oh!
-I'm 18, I got my whole life ahead of me,
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and it's not like my boyfriend's begging
me to marry him.
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Boyfriends rarely do.
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>-His name's Strib, short for Dennis.
-Uh, sure.
</p><timestamp>00:03:30</timestamp>
<p>He's not exactly the romantic type,
but he's got those eyes
you just can't say no to, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I hope you and Strib have
many happy child-free years, together.
</p><timestamp>00:03:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'm willing to do whatever I can
to help contribute to the child-free part.
</p><timestamp>00:03:42</timestamp>
<p>-Hmm.
-<subtitle>phone buzzing, meowing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>Oh, sorry. It's work.
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Everyone I work with is such a baby.
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And I love babies!
<subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>Hello, baby.
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hey, listen, I know Flip
just wants me to be "the woman",
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and keep my mouth shut,
but this show makes no sense.
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}In the rooftop motorcycle scene,
Fritz and Philbert keep saying,
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<i>"This is so dangerous."</i>
<i>"Yeah, man. We're really dangerous."</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>But then they just get off
the motorcycles.
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Why aren't they skidding
towards the side of the building,
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and then they roll off just as their bikes
go careening over the edge?
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>Okay, sure, pitch it to Flip.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>Everything I pitch, he shoots down.
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>That's just because it's coming
from someone who isn't him.
</p><timestamp>00:04:16</timestamp>
<p>If you want him to like your idea,
just convince him
he thought of it, himself.
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You really think he'll do it
because I say it's his idea?
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>That's a great idea, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>Oh, thanks! I'm gonna do it.
</p><timestamp>00:04:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-So sorry.
-No problem.
</p><timestamp>00:04:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Um, just so you know, I have met with
some other candidates, mostly couples.
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I couldn't believe I found someone
who grew up in Eden.
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>-When's the last time you were here?
-Oh, not since my mother died.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, I'm sorry.
-It was a long time ago.
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>-She's still dead, though.
-That is true.
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sipping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>-Sorry we had to meet at Phuzzy's.
-I love Phuzzy's.
</p><timestamp>00:04:50</timestamp>
<p>I bet you got fancy restaurants
in LA, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>Probably a California Pizza Kitchen
on every corner.
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>Or do y'all call it "Pizza Kitchen,"
since you're in California?
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>No, we call it "California Pizza Kitchen,"
or "CPK."
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>CPK? What kind of city person's too busy
to say "California Pizza Kitchen"?
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>You gotta catch a bus or something?
Stay a while and say the whole name.
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah, well, I'm not like that.
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>I live in Los Angeles now,
but you know what they say,
you can take the girl
out of the Greensboro-High Point
metropolitan area, but you can't take
the Greensboro-High Point
metropolitan area out of the girl.
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>I wish my boyfriend would've taken
his penis out of the girl.
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>-Meaning, I wish he would've pulled out.
-Yeah, no, I got it.
</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, have I missed this!
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna eat the shit
out of these hush puppies,
and then tomorrow,
I'm getting a real sausage biscuit,
meaning a sausage patty,
not that bullshit link situation
they call "sausage" in LA.
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>both laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my goodness, I gotta pee.
I'll be right back.

<p>-<subtitle>grunts, sighs</subtitle>
-<subtitle>phone buzzing, meowing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>-Hello?
-Princess Carolyn!
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>I just wanted to tell you what a ball
I'm having on this crazy cop show.
</p><timestamp>00:05:53</timestamp>
<p>Glad to hear it.
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>And my favorite star paid
for a food truck.
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>I don't know why Peter Scolari is buying
me a falafel plate,
but, hey, I'm not complaining.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>-Did you have a question?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:06:03</timestamp>
<p>So, I know my ex-wife is
in the writers' room.
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to make things weird for her
or anybody else, so...
do I have to do all the dialogue,
as scripted,
or can I have a little fun with it?
</p><timestamp>00:06:16</timestamp>
<p>-Um--
<i>-Normally, I wouldn't even ask,</i>
but because of the whole<i> ex-wife</i>
of it all,
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p>I figured I should just double-check
that it's definitely okay
if I change every single word.
</p><timestamp>00:06:25</timestamp>
<p>Knowing Flip,
I would just stick to the script.
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>So, don't flip the script?
</p><timestamp>00:06:28</timestamp>
<p>-Exactly. Don't flip Flip's script.
-<i>That's a double-flip.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>So, you're saying I should flip it?
</p><timestamp>00:06:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm saying the exact opposite.
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>-So, flip it. Flip it good.
-Okay, I gotta go.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>You're very funny and talented.
Goodbye. Sorry. Show folk.
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>Well, this was a pleasure.
Thanks for coming all this way.
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>I do hope to make a decision soon.
</p><timestamp>00:06:46</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, you have to leave already?
-Yeah, I gotta go set up my booth.
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>-Your booth?
-At the flea market.
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>I sell clothes I bought cheap
and then bedazzled.
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>I'm not saying I'm the Danville Target
or nothing,
but it's good enough for fleas.
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p>Okay, call me if you have
any other questions.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>I always answer my phone,
day or night.
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>Thanks.

</p><timestamp>00:07:15</timestamp>
<p>Your mom's drunk again, isn't she?
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>My mom, well, obviously she was planning
on cleaning the floors,
but I asked her if I could do it.
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>I wanna learn all the tricks of the trade,
so one day,
</p><timestamp>00:07:24</timestamp>
<p>I can be as good a housekeeper
as she is.
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>Why do you still live here?
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you go live with your dad
down in Raleigh?
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>All my sisters and brothers are gone.
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>If I leave, my mom's got nobody.
</p><timestamp>00:07:34</timestamp>
<p>Besides, if I go,
who's going to keep you out of trouble?
</p><timestamp>00:07:38</timestamp>
<p>Did you know I'm on the football team?
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> I do know it.
Are you ever gonna play?
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>Probably not, smart-ass.
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>Not unless the first-string quarterback
gets hurt.
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>Why aren't you
the first-string quarterback?
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>You're not even
first-string housekeeper!
</p><timestamp>00:07:51</timestamp>
<p>Well, how about I first-string punch you
in the nose?
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>Oh! Okay, easy, easy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>Look, I think if I just keep my head down
and be patient,
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>Coach will eventually realize
I should be QB one, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>That's a terrible approach.
</p><timestamp>00:08:03</timestamp>
<p>You need to go after what <i>you </i>want.
</p><timestamp>00:08:05</timestamp>
<p>You gotta fly into that sun,
like Amelia Earhart did.
</p><timestamp>00:08:08</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-You know, like in the movie.
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>I never knew anybody who liked old movies
as much as you do.
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>You're 18.
You never knew anybody, period.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>Okay, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>But what if I'm not as good a quarterback
as I think I am?
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>Doesn't matter.
You don't need to be good enough.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>You just need to convince your coach
you're good enough.
</p><timestamp>00:08:25</timestamp>
<p>Damn! You know what?
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>-I'll talk to him tomorrow.
-Don't leave until you get that yes.
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>bell jingling</subtitle>
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:08:35</timestamp>
<p>-Sadie, wait!
-Oh. Um, hey.
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>Listen, I really want to spend more time
getting to know each other.
</p><timestamp>00:08:41</timestamp>
<p>This baby, your baby,
means everything to me.
</p><timestamp>00:08:44</timestamp>
<p>I think the more time we spend together,
</p><timestamp>00:08:46</timestamp>
<p>-you'll realize I'm--
-<subtitle>phone meowing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>-Do you need to take that?
-No, it's fine. The perfect candidate.
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>I thought you always answered your phone,
day or night.
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>Right. Hello?
</p><timestamp>00:08:55</timestamp>
<p>I just got off the phone with Flip.
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>He's really excited about
this new motorcycle stunt he came up with.
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>-He wants to do it tomorrow, but--
-That's Flip, full of ideas. Gotta go.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>Well, the show is already way over budget
and my boss is starting to ask questions.
</p><timestamp>00:09:08</timestamp>
<p>Now, normally, I love questions
because they're good for pondering,
</p><timestamp>00:09:12</timestamp>
<p><i>but I guess in the corporate world,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p><i>when people ask questions,</i>
<i>they expect someone to answer them.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>And, apparently,
"Yeah, wow, it really makes you think,"
is not the kind of answer
they're looking for.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>Goodbye, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>-<i>Wait, one more thing.</i>
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>Do you think Lake Erie ever gets jealous
of Lake Superior?
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>Or is it, like, proud to be the eerie one?
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>We've been through this, Todd.
Lakes don't have emotions.
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p>What about Ricki Lake?
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>As I was saying, I'd love to spend
more time together, if you're up for it.
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>You mentioned the flea market.
I'd love to check it out.
</p><timestamp>00:09:43</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, come by anytime tomorrow.
-I thought it was today.
</p><timestamp>00:09:45</timestamp>
<p>No, no. I just have to prep for it today.
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>But if you can stay another day,
that would be awesome.
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p>But only if you can. I know you're busy.
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>I don't want me, or my baby,
to get in the way of your career.
</p><timestamp>00:09:56</timestamp>
<p>Sadie, I'll be there.

No, just do it through the website.

<p>Yeah, no, go to the website

</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>-Mom.
-Let me tell you something.
</p><timestamp>00:11:33</timestamp>
<p>Life is a big ol' roulette wheel.
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>Everyone's got a number.
Some are winners, some aren't.
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>It all depends
where the little white ball lands.
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>The problem is when people
with losing numbers think they're winners.
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>I don't know what you're talking about.
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>-Then what the hell are these?
-College brochures. I--
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>You think you're going
to some fancy college in California,
all the way on the other side
of the country from your mother?
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>-You're gonna abandon me?
-Mom, it's not about you.
</p><timestamp>00:11:57</timestamp>
<p>UCLA?
No, you will not see LA.
</p><timestamp>00:12:01</timestamp>
<p>Even if you get into one of these places,
how're you gonna pay for it?
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>I'll get a job or a paid internship.
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>Well, la-di-da, I did not realize
I was in the presence of someone,
</p><timestamp>00:12:11</timestamp>
<p>-who was gonna get a paid internship.
-Mom, you need to go to bed.
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>See, that's the difference
between you and me, Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>I know where I belong.
This is my bed.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p><i>-Where are you?</i>
-Something came up.
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, listen, Mr. Peanutbutter's
doing all his own stunts,
and every time he does
a dumb little somersault,
everybody goes nuts
like he's goddamn Kerri Strug.
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p>Kerri Strug?
You gotta update your references.
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p>When the world sees
the likes of Kerri Strug, again,
</p><timestamp>00:12:43</timestamp>
<p>I will adjust accordingly.
</p><timestamp>00:12:45</timestamp>
<p><i>Anyway, I said I wanted to do</i>
<i>my own stunts, too,</i>
but little did I know
that Flip was writing a new scene,
where a motorcycle falls off
a five-story building.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>Just say you don't want to do it.
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p><i>I cannot do that</i>
<i>because I already fired my stunt double,</i>
so I also need you to call him
and get him back,
and that might be tricky,
'cause I was really brutal about it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:02</timestamp>
<p>-Why?
-Because people were watching.
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p>Now I need you to intervene
and forbid me from doing my own stunts,
even though I want to,
because I actually don't want to,
because that would require me to be
in good shape, which we know I'm not,
and also not a coward,
which we both know I am.
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack--
-<i>Also, if you could say</i>
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p><i>it's because I'm too important a star</i>
<i>to take the risk on,</i>
but Mr. Peanutbutter can keep doing
his stunts
because he is less important;
that would be real cool, thanks.
</p><timestamp>00:13:24</timestamp>
<p>Fine, I'll handle it!
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>Just stop whining like a little bitch!

<p>It's the best thing in this whole place

</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p>Wow!
That's pretty manipulative.
</p><timestamp>00:14:09</timestamp>

<p>-That boy's stuck with you, now.
-Stuck with me?
</p><timestamp>00:14:38</timestamp>
<p>No, good stuck,

your friend's fancy ring
and it won't come off.
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>Now you got a free ring.
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>You know, Evelyn still expects you
to give that ring back.
</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>That sounds like an Evelyn problem.

</p><timestamp>00:20:06</timestamp>
<p>Miscarriages don't "just happen."
This was our ticket.
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p>That baby would've changed
everything for us.
</p><timestamp>00:20:13</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sobs</subtitle> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
</p><timestamp>00:20:16</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> It's not your fault.
</p><timestamp>00:20:19</timestamp>
<p>We just got losing numbers.
</p><timestamp>00:20:22</timestamp>
<p>Well, maybe Cooper will marry me, anyway?
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>Oh, sweetie, you've been watching
too many of those old movies.
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>Coopers don't marry gals like you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:31</timestamp>
<p>He's gonna end up with some fancy heiress,
like Samantha Floppy-Disk.
</p><timestamp>00:20:35</timestamp>
<p>Besides, you don't want that life.
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>-You're free now.
-Free to do what?
</p><timestamp>00:20:42</timestamp>
<p>I wasn't gonna tell you,
but this came in the mail.

<p>-Hello?

</p><timestamp>00:20:56</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah.
-This is all my fault.
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>I thought the stunt was Flip's idea.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>Well, no, I just convinced him
it was his idea.
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>That's not what I heard.
I heard it was Flip's idea.
</p><timestamp>00:21:07</timestamp>
<p>-Right, but that's just--
-It was Flip's idea.
</p><timestamp>00:21:09</timestamp>
<p>How are you not getting this?
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>Do you only seem smart
because you wear glasses?
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Okay, it was Flip's idea.
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>Great. I'll see you tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p>-Hey.
-Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:21:19</timestamp>
<p>Listen, I've known me some Stribs.
A little sweet, a little dangerous.
</p><timestamp>00:21:23</timestamp>
<p>But the second things get complicated,
he'll run away.
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p>-You don't know my Strib.
-But I know you. And you are too special
to settle for the first guy
who rolls up on a motorcycle
and says, <subtitle>drawls</subtitle>
"I love you or whatever."
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>Well, I haven't decided
what I'm gonna do yet anyway.
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p>You're a bright girl,
and you've got an incredible future.
</p><timestamp>00:21:39</timestamp>
<p>Let me ask you something.
Did you really like the clothes I made?
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>Of course I did.
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>Then why didn't you buy anything
for yourself?
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>-Sadie...
-You're bullshitting me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>-This is just another sale for you.
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:21:50</timestamp>
<p>You think I'm stupid,
but I've been watching you bullshit,
everyone on that phone of yours.
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>I want to give your baby the best life,
the best schools, the best opportunities--
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>You think, because you left her,
you're better.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>Because of your fancy show business,
you can take whatever you want.
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>-No, no, no, you don't understand.
-Well, I got something you can't have,
and no amount of your managing
or producing is gonna change that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>I just want to help you.
I want to give your baby a better life.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>Better than what?
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>Better than a sky fulla stars?
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>deep breath</subtitle> Okay, Sadie,
you do whatever you want.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>You want to keep the baby,
you want to give the baby
to someone else, fine.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>Just do, what <i>you </i>want to do.
</p><timestamp>00:22:30</timestamp>
<p>Don't live your life for Strib,
or this baby, or anybody else.
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>-I know that.
-Okay. Good.
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>-Thank you.

</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p><i>-She's gonna keep looking.</i>
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>Ugh! I'm sorry.
This is the hardest part of my job,

<p><i>when I have to lie to the clients</i>

</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>

<p>Uh, it's your fault I feel amazing?
</p><timestamp>00:23:26</timestamp>
<p>I don't know what that doctor gave me,

more often.
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>Hey, quick question... is this a train?
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>I'm on my way home.
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>I'll come check on you
as soon as I get there.
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I'm golden. Let me tell you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>You accidentally drive a motorcycle
off a building,
and suddenly
you are everybody's favorite guy.
</p><timestamp>00:23:44</timestamp>
<p>We did it, Princess Carolyn. Back on top!

<p>Okay. Bye, Mom. Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>Hey, I got a nutty idea.
What if you deferred for a year?
</p><timestamp>00:24:05</timestamp>
<p>Mom, I-I can't do that.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>Of course you could.
Los Angeles isn't going nowhere.
</p><timestamp>00:24:11</timestamp>
<p>Just another year.
</p><timestamp>00:24:13</timestamp>
<p>By that time, Boots will be out of rehab,
and he can come home, and help out.
</p><timestamp>00:24:17</timestamp>
<p>-Just wait until then.
-Mom, please.
</p><timestamp>00:24:19</timestamp>
<p>A year. You'll hardly notice it.
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p>-No, Mom. I gotta go.
-Please?
</p><timestamp>00:24:25</timestamp>
<p>Can't you just do this one thing for me?
</p><timestamp>00:24:29</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, Mom.
