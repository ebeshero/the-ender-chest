<p>{\an8}In 1987, the situation comedy
<i>Horsin' Around</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}premiered on ABC.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>The show, in which
a young, bachelor horse
is forced to reevaluate
his priorities
when he agrees to raise
three human children,
was initially dismissed
by critics
as broad and saccharine
and not good,
but the family comedy struck
a chord with America
and went on to air
for nine seasons.
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p>The star of <i>Horsin' Around</i>,
BoJack Horseman,
is our guest tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:00:51</timestamp>
<p>Welcome, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:00:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It is good to be here,
Charlie.
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sorry I was late.
The traffic--
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>It's really no problem.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>I parked
in a handicapped spot.
</p><timestamp>00:00:57</timestamp>
<p>I hope that's okay.
</p><timestamp>00:00:59</timestamp>
<p>You parked in a--
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, disabled spot.
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>Is that the proper nomenclature?
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>Maybe you should
move the car.
</p><timestamp>00:01:05</timestamp>
<p>No, I don't think
I should drive right now.
</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm incredibly drunk.
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p>You're telling me
that you're drunk right now?
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>Is it just me,
or am I nailing this interview?
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p>I kind of feel like
I'm nailing it.
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, we were talking
about <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:19</timestamp>
<p>To what do you attribute
the show's wide appeal?
</p><timestamp>00:01:21</timestamp>
<p>Charlie, listen, you know,
</p><timestamp>00:01:23</timestamp>
<p>I know that it's very hip
these days
to shit
all over <i>Horsin' Around</i>,
but at the time,
I can tell you--
</p><timestamp>00:01:27</timestamp>
<p>- Is it okay to say "shit"?
- Please don't.
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>'Cause I-- I think the show's
actually pretty solid
for what it is.
</p><timestamp>00:01:31</timestamp>
<p>It's not Ibsen, sure,
but look,
for a lot of people,
life is just one long,
hard kick in the urethra,
and sometimes
when you get home
from a long day of
getting kicked in the urethra,
you just want to watch a show
about good, likable people
who love each other,
where, you know,
no matter what happens,
at the end of 30 minutes,
everything's
gonna turn out okay.
</p><timestamp>00:01:50</timestamp>
<p>You know,
because in real life--
</p><timestamp>00:01:52</timestamp>
<p>Did I already say the thing
about the urethra?
</p><timestamp>00:01:55</timestamp>
<p>Well, let's talk
about real life.
</p><timestamp>00:01:56</timestamp>
<p>What have you been doing
since the show's cancellation
</p><timestamp>00:01:58</timestamp>
<p>18 years ago?
</p><timestamp>00:02:00</timestamp>
<p>That's a great question,
Charlie.
</p><timestamp>00:02:01</timestamp>
<p>I, uh...
</p><timestamp>00:02:03</timestamp>
<p>Uh, I...

</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>It's called being polite,
BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>But am I crazy
that this is a bad time?
</p><timestamp>00:09:20</timestamp>
<p>Always a Clydesdale,
never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:09:24</timestamp>
<p>You'll get that one later,
man.
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>Erica, get out of here
with that face.
</p><timestamp>00:09:27</timestamp>
<p>Would it kill you to be civil?
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>This is why we're breaking up.
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>So it's not because
of the thing with the baby?
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>It's because
of a lot of things!
</p><timestamp>00:09:34</timestamp>
<p>Waiter, could we please
have the check?
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>- Thank you.
- We haven't even ordered yet.
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>I have wasted so many dinners
on you, BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>I don't know how you can expect
anyone else to love you
when you so clearly
hate yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>- Here you go.
- Let me see that.
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p><i>$10 for bread?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to live
in a society
where the premeal bread
isn't free.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>It is free
if you order a meal.
</p><timestamp>00:09:56</timestamp>
<p>Can you take me home, please?
</p><timestamp>00:09:58</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but I didn't even
eat that much bread.
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>What did I have?
I must have had--
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>You ate nine baskets, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>Nine--
really?
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>Great, now I'm gonna feel like
a fat ass all week.
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>You've seen me naked.
Do you think I'm getting chubby?
</p><timestamp>00:10:10</timestamp>
<p>You want to know the real
reason we're breaking up?
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>What was that?
Sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:10:13</timestamp>
<p>Couldn't hear you over the sound
of my calories not metabolizing.
</p><timestamp>00:10:15</timestamp>
<p>This is so classic you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:18</timestamp>
<p>You're using this bread thing
to avoid talking
about our relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:10:21</timestamp>
<p>No, that is definitely
not happening.
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>I'd like to go home now.
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>
<p>You think I'm fat.
</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>
<p>So yeah,
technically I was dumped,
but the real headline
of the evening was,
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>
<p>"Dumb guy eats bread,
gets fat, the end."
</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>What kind of headline
is that?
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>Wasn't there a pizza here
a second ago?
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p>God damn it!
Stop the presses.
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>You're not fat.
</p><timestamp>00:10:43</timestamp>
<p>Oh, hey, let's throw a party.
That'll cheer you up.
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>No, it won't.
It'll cheer you up.
</p><timestamp>00:10:49</timestamp>
<p>I'll stand in the corner
by myself
eating cotton candy
until I barf
like I did at your last party.
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>Hey, aren't you the horse
from <i>Horsin' Around</i>?
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:11:00</timestamp>
<p>That was a good party.
</p><timestamp>00:11:02</timestamp>
<p>Hey, didn't we get a cotton
candy machine for that party?
</p><timestamp>00:11:05</timestamp>
<p>Who told you Princess Carolyn
and I broke up?
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>- She did.
- What?
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>You never took me home, jerk!
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>Oh, everything's my fault.
</p><timestamp>00:11:12</timestamp>
<p>Take me home.
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>Okay, jeez.
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p>But I'm not looking
for parking in Silver Lake.
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>I'll slow the car down
to a crawl,
and you can duck and roll.
</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>
<p>You know what, you can take
a last look at this face,
because it's the last time
you're gonna see it.

<p>Oh, my God,

</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but I'm still
your agent.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>I pride myself on my ability
to separate my professional life
from my personal life.
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>Great.
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>Then, as my agent,
do you think I'm getting fat?
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>No way.
</p><timestamp>00:11:50</timestamp>
<p>You are in the prime of
your life, never looked better.
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>What about
as my ex-girlfriend?
</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>You look like a pile of crap
ate a second pile of crap
and then crapped out
a third pile of crap.
</p><timestamp>00:11:57</timestamp>
<p>Wait, wait, so which pile
of crap do I look like?
</p><timestamp>00:12:00</timestamp>
<p>- The third one.
- What? That's the worst one.
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>I'm not calling you

</p><timestamp>00:12:14</timestamp>
<p>I told you, that's not

<p>I was masturbating to what
