<p>What troubles you, Sister?
</p><timestamp>00:00:20</timestamp>
<p>It's the woman who came from the water.
She's been in our care for two years.
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>She hasn't spoken a word
and spends her days in a fog.
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>Have you been steadfast in your prayers?
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>I have. And yet,
her condition does not improve.
</p><timestamp>00:00:33</timestamp>
<p>"And yet"? Is prayer but a bargain?
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>Is it for <i>you </i>to present terms
to the Lord?
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>No, Mother. I just--
</p><timestamp>00:00:40</timestamp>
<p>You seek a sign from God.
Should He seek <i>less </i>from you?

<p>Take the woman to the seaside
tomorrow after Matins.
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>Prove your faith to Him
that He might reveal His glory to you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:54</timestamp>
<p>Yes, Mother.
</p><timestamp>00:00:59</timestamp>
<p>Can you feel that on your feet?
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>That's water. Water.

<p>This is hopeless! I want to help you,

<p>I look at your face and think
you could be literally anyone.

God, they always gotta slant it.
</p><timestamp>00:03:01</timestamp>
<p>Why can't it just be "depth"?
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>I'd hate to see you after a bad review.
</p><timestamp>00:03:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, and I bet "eponymous"

<p>{\an8}Damn, look at me-- in two sentences.
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Well, don't let it go to your head.
Probably just because you're a good actor.
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, I got you something
for the premiere party.
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-These are beautiful, BoJack.
-Well, don't let it go to your head.
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>It's because you visited me
in the hospital every day,
and I got used to having you around,
and it turns out I like you.
</p><timestamp>00:03:34</timestamp>
<p>Uh-oh. I let them go to my head.

<p>Play nice, Flip.
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p>If this gets out, everyone will be talking
about the stolen gag,
instead of all the great parts of the show
that weren't stolen.
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>Fine. What do you want?
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>I want what every comedy writer wants.

<p>Oh! What if I just let you come
to the premiere party with us?
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>They have tiny tacos in soft shells
that are impossible to fold
without making a big mess.

<p>I can only give permission
for the part I wrote.
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>I'm the set-up guy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:52</timestamp>
<p>If you want the punch line,
you gotta talk to Ziggy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>Can you ask him to sign the release?
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>I can't even ask him the best time
to go to the dentist.
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>He hasn't talked to me for 30 years.
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>

and drink specialty cocktails,
and form life-long bonds
with other fancy celebrities,
and read in magazines,
"Who wore it better?"
</p><timestamp>00:08:17</timestamp>
<p>And then people vote,
and then 78 percent of readers say,

<p>FYI, you're gonna want pictures of her
after you see what she does in <i>Philbert.</i>

<p>Let me tell you something,
that 39-year-old actress is going places.

<p>-Oh. Hey.
-What happened to your arm?
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, just some asshole got T-boned by me.
-Oh, my God. When?
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>Uh... couple weeks ago? Or months?

<p>As Philbert says, "Time is like a woman;
completely impossible to comprehend."
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>

because the network was worried
it would be offensive

what time it was.

painting canvas after canvas of my wife,

rediscover the woman I fell in love with
those many years ago?

<p>No, such a realization would only crush
my too-feeble heart.
</p><timestamp>00:10:24</timestamp>
<p>After all, what benefit is it to love
without the words to express it?
</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>
<p>What could I possibly say to articulate

who has become but a stranger to me now?

<p>I'm actually about to head out
to the <i>Philbert</i> premiere party.
</p><timestamp>00:11:10</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Henry</subtitle> <i>I'm coming.</i>
-Brilliant! You'll take him with you!
</p><timestamp>00:11:13</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no, no.
He doesn't need to come.
</p><timestamp>00:11:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Henry</subtitle> <i>I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>
<i>Oh, God, I'm coming.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>Whatever you say... boss.
</p><timestamp>00:11:21</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>splattering</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:23</timestamp>
<p>Hello, everyone.
</p><timestamp>00:11:24</timestamp>
<p>Thank you for attending the premiere
of my opus.
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p>I hope you all enjoy it
because that means you are smart.
</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p>If you don't get it, that means
that my genius wasn't appreciated
in my own time, and that's okay, too.
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>weak laughter</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:36</timestamp>
<p>Why are you laughing?
Please do not laugh during the screening.
</p><timestamp>00:11:39</timestamp>
<p>This episode contains
no intentional humor.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Okay. That's--
that's always a good sign,
when you have to clarify that.
Look, folks, Herb is being modest.
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>-"Herb"?
-I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Flip. Did I say Herb?
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>Herb is being modest,
but he put together a tremendous show
that I think that you guys
are really gonna love.
</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p>That's right.
It all came out of this brain.
</p><timestamp>00:12:01</timestamp>
<p>-Ha! That brain, he says?
-That brain? Double-ha!
</p><timestamp>00:12:05</timestamp>
<p>Shh!
</p><timestamp>00:12:06</timestamp>
<p>And the most amazing thing about this show
is that I'm sure we all have Philberts
in our lives,
or we are Philberts.
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>You know, we've all done terrible things
that we deeply regret.
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>I've done so many... unforgivable things.
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>And I think that,
that's what this show says.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>Is that... is that we're all terrible,
so therefore we're all... okay.
</p><timestamp>00:12:27</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:12:27</timestamp>
<p>And I think
that's a really powerful message.
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, without further ado,
the first chapter,
and notice I said "chapter" not episode
because I think of this show as more
of a novel than a TV show...
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>-of <i>Philbert!</i>

</p><timestamp>00:12:59</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Pickles, where have you been?
You left after, like, ten minutes.
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:13:03</timestamp>
<p>My friend Ilana, not my best friend Ilana,
but another Ilana who is my friend,
was having a crisis,
and I needed to text her "LOL."
</p><timestamp>00:13:09</timestamp>
<p>Well, you missed the whole episode.
</p><timestamp>00:13:11</timestamp>
<p>I saw the first ten minutes!
I just couldn't get into it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:14</timestamp>
<p>And you kept saying,
</p><timestamp>00:13:15</timestamp>
<p>"Do you love it? Are you loving it?
How did you like that scene?"
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>Well, did you love it? Were you loving it?
How did you like that scene?
</p><timestamp>00:13:21</timestamp>
<p>Every time you showed up on screen,
I kept thinking,
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>"That's not a dirty cop,
that's my boyfriend!
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>The sweetest, cutest dog
in the whole world!"
</p><timestamp>00:13:29</timestamp>
<p>And then you'd shoot someone,
and I was like... eww!
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p>-Fritz is the hardest I've ever acted.
-Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>Harder than the ice bucket challenge,
but it was fake ice.
I wanted you to see it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:38</timestamp>
<p>I'm going to fix this.
You stay here and party.
</p><timestamp>00:13:40</timestamp>
<p>I'll go home.
I'll watch the entire season of your show.
</p><timestamp>00:13:43</timestamp>
<p>You don't have to do that.
</p><timestamp>00:13:44</timestamp>
<p>And you don't have to like every one
of my Instagram posts, but you do.
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>The least I could do
is watch your TV show,
even if it kills me
because I hate it so much.
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>-Well, don't watch it if you hate it.
-I'm going to do this for us.
</p><timestamp>00:13:58</timestamp>
<p>-But--
-I love you!
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
-<subtitle>buzzing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>I've been to dozens of these things
and I've never heard applause like that.
</p><timestamp>00:14:06</timestamp>
<p>We might actually get a season two.
</p><timestamp>00:14:07</timestamp>
<p>-That's never happened to me before.
-That's incredible.
</p><timestamp>00:14:10</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me,
can I borrow you for a few minutes?
</p><timestamp>00:14:13</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, sure. Gina, do you mind if I, um...?
-Yeah, go ahead.
</p><timestamp>00:14:15</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no, I was actually talking to Gina.
</p><timestamp>00:14:18</timestamp>
<p>Me? I'm being borrowed for a few minutes?
</p><timestamp>00:14:20</timestamp>
<p>Oh! Well, yeah. Yeah, of course.
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:14:23</timestamp>
<p>Wow. Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:14:25</timestamp>
<p>Hey, how you doing? Hey, you came!
</p><timestamp>00:14:27</timestamp>
<p>Flip, I screwed up.
I didn't know it would feel like that.
</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p>To be in that room.
To hear people cheering <i>for Philbert!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:14:33</timestamp>
<p>-What are you talking about?
-When I first started on this job,
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>I wanted to make <i>Philbert</i>
more well-rounded,
so the audience
could relate to him better.
</p><timestamp>00:14:40</timestamp>
<p>And now you're upset
because I didn't mention you
in my introduction.
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>Diane, the whole point of television
is it's a collaborative medium,
</p><timestamp>00:14:48</timestamp>
<p>-where one person gets all the credit.
-No, it's not about that.
</p><timestamp>00:14:52</timestamp>
<p>I made him more vulnerable,
and that made him more likable,
which makes for a better TV show.
</p><timestamp>00:14:57</timestamp>
<p>But if <i>Philbert</i> is just a way
to help dumb assholes<i> </i>rationalize
their own awful behavior,
well, I'm sorry,
but we can't put this out there.
</p><timestamp>00:15:04</timestamp>
<p>Uh, it's out there.
</p><timestamp>00:15:05</timestamp>
<p>The whole season's dropping at midnight
all over the world.
</p><timestamp>00:15:08</timestamp>
<p>-I can't be here.
-<subtitle>Flip sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:10</timestamp>
<p>Come on, fellas.
I know we can find a solution here.
</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>
<p>I doubt it.
</p><timestamp>00:15:14</timestamp>
<p>We have the same problem
as a hematology lab
that goes a week without electricity!
</p><timestamp>00:15:19</timestamp>
<p>Too much bad blood!
</p><timestamp>00:15:21</timestamp>
<p>But you obviously work together so well.
What went wrong?
</p><timestamp>00:15:24</timestamp>
<p>It was a long time ago.
</p><timestamp>00:15:26</timestamp>
<p>My wife Harriet
always had a sneaker for Ziggy.
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>Oh, and the unspoken resentment crept in?
</p><timestamp>00:15:31</timestamp>
<p>Unspoken? It was shouted!
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p>Nevertheless, me and Harriet ended up
having a fling.
</p><timestamp>00:15:36</timestamp>
<p>Eventually, we got married.
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>
<p>-And that killed the partnership?
-No, we got over that.
</p><timestamp>00:15:40</timestamp>
<p>But at their tenth anniversary,
I had a few too many--
</p><timestamp>00:15:43</timestamp>
<p>And what, you took a swing at him?
</p><timestamp>00:15:45</timestamp>
<p>I said I always felt
he had the easier job,
coming up with the punch lines.
</p><timestamp>00:15:49</timestamp>
<p>And then what? What led to the rift?
</p><timestamp>00:15:51</timestamp>
<p>Led? That's the whole rift!
He besmirched my craft.
</p><timestamp>00:15:55</timestamp>
<p>I still haven't forgiven
the son of a bitch!
</p><timestamp>00:15:57</timestamp>
<p>I said it then, and I stand by it now!
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p>All the pressure's on the punch line!
</p><timestamp>00:16:04</timestamp>
<p>Pressure? Please!
</p><timestamp>00:16:05</timestamp>
<p>Set-ups need context,
mise-en-scène, flavor!
</p><timestamp>00:16:09</timestamp>
<p>I carried us to the top
of the Popsicle stick game!
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>
<p>You wrote the part
they let you try before you buy!
</p><timestamp>00:16:15</timestamp>
<p>I had to deliver the money line!
</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>both</subtitle> Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>So, you both think you had the harder job?
</p><timestamp>00:16:21</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Abel</subtitle> Of course!
-Indubitably!
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>Well, what if you tried switching roles?
</p><timestamp>00:16:24</timestamp>
<p>-You mean, I tag <i>his </i>set-ups?
-Why not?
</p><timestamp>00:16:27</timestamp>
<p>I don't know.
I'm a punch line guy my whole life.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>How do I come up with straight lines?
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p>-You could try using a ruler.
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:16:36</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>both laugh</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, I missed you, Abel!
-You, too, Zig!
</p><timestamp>00:16:42</timestamp>
<p>All right, so we have a deal?
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>
<p>What did the terminally ill man say
to Dr. Kevorkian?
</p><timestamp>00:16:47</timestamp>
<p>"Give me that sweet release!"
</p><timestamp>00:16:53</timestamp>
<p>Hey.
</p><timestamp>00:16:54</timestamp>
<p>Did you really mean what you said,
before the screening?
</p><timestamp>00:16:57</timestamp>
<p>About how Philbert made you feel okay,
about yourself?
</p><timestamp>00:17:00</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I don't know--
</p><timestamp>00:17:01</timestamp>
<p>Because, you know,
that's not the point of Philbert--
for guys to watch it and feel okay.
</p><timestamp>00:17:06</timestamp>
<p>Diane, it's a compliment.
You did a good job. Relax.
</p><timestamp>00:17:08</timestamp>
<p>I don't want you, or anyone else,
justifying their shitty behavior
because of the show.
</p><timestamp>00:17:12</timestamp>
<p>What is your problem?
</p><timestamp>00:17:13</timestamp>
<p>Why can't you accept
that something you did is successful?
</p><timestamp>00:17:16</timestamp>
<p>It's connecting to people,
and that's good.
</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>You're right, sorry.
I don't know why I thought you would care.
</p><timestamp>00:17:20</timestamp>
<p>-Excuse me?
-What is going on with you? You're a mess.
</p><timestamp>00:17:23</timestamp>
<p>-Am I?
-I feel like I barely know you anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:17:27</timestamp>
<p>Oh, bullshit. Don't give me that.
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>-It's true. I don't know you.
-No. You know me. You do.
</p><timestamp>00:17:31</timestamp>
<p>Then what the hell happened in New Mexico?
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>Look, I...
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>I don't know what you think
that you know--
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>
<p>I don't know anything!
</p><timestamp>00:17:38</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I know something happened
with a girl in New Mexico,
and I know it resulted in
you coming home in a boat.
</p><timestamp>00:17:44</timestamp>
<p>-Well, that's--
-I also know...
that your old friend Charlotte
lives in New Mexico
because you used to leave
her business card lying around the house,
and I know her daughter is a senior
at Oberlin.
</p><timestamp>00:17:52</timestamp>
<p>-How--?
-And I know you went to Oberlin
during your bender three years ago
because a bunch of students
posted pictures of you on Facebook.
</p><timestamp>00:17:58</timestamp>
<p>Jesus Christ,
why are you so obsessed with me?
</p><timestamp>00:18:01</timestamp>
<p>I am not obsessed.
</p><timestamp>00:18:02</timestamp>
<p>I wanted to know what happened,
and you wouldn't tell me.
</p><timestamp>00:18:05</timestamp>
<p>-You never asked!
-Okay, so I'm asking now.
</p><timestamp>00:18:08</timestamp>
<p>What happened in New Mexico?
</p><timestamp>00:18:10</timestamp>
<p>-Hallo! Smile for Yahoo, Finland!
-<subtitle>camera shutter clicks</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:13</timestamp>
<p>What I don't understand is why you feel
like you deserve to know
every shitty thing I ever did.
</p><timestamp>00:18:18</timestamp>
<p>I don't deserve anything.
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>I would like to know
when you've done shitty things.
</p><timestamp>00:18:22</timestamp>
<p>Why is that your business?
</p><timestamp>00:18:23</timestamp>
<p>Because I'm your friend,
and I care about you,
and I wrote a book about you,
and now I wrote this show for you,
and I am very publicly your friend,
so if it gets out that you're doing
creepy stuff, that makes me look bad.
</p><timestamp>00:18:35</timestamp>
<p>Oh! So you're worried about things
that I may have done
because you think
that it reflects badly on <i>you?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:18:41</timestamp>
<p>Hurts your brand?
That's your moral high ground?
</p><timestamp>00:18:43</timestamp>
<p>This is not about "moral high ground."
</p><timestamp>00:18:45</timestamp>
<p>Wanna know about New Mexico?
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p>You want to know about the one
little thing that I did in New Mexico,
which, by the way,
wasn't even really a thing?
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>-You know what? Spare me.
-No, I'm gonna tell you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:53</timestamp>
<p>I'll tell you what you want.
</p><timestamp>00:18:54</timestamp>
<p>And while I'm at it, you wanna hear about
what happened at the MTV beach house?
</p><timestamp>00:18:57</timestamp>
<p>Or why I'm not allowed
to fly United anymore?
</p><timestamp>00:18:59</timestamp>
<p>Or what happened with Sharona,
the makeup lady on <i>Horsing Around?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:19:02</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Or the dozens of other shady things
that may or may not have occurred
in my life that I can barely even remember
</p><timestamp>00:19:07</timestamp>
<p>'cause I was high or drunk
or it was 30 years ago?
</p><timestamp>00:19:10</timestamp>
<p>And you don't feel bad,
about any of this stuff?
</p><timestamp>00:19:12</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, of course I do!
I've spent so much time feeling bad.
</p><timestamp>00:19:15</timestamp>
<p>By the way, most of these women...
don't even remember, I bet.
</p><timestamp>00:19:19</timestamp>
<p>Well, that's really convenient for you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:21</timestamp>
<p>I'm the one
who has to live with this shit.
</p><timestamp>00:19:22</timestamp>
<p>I'm the one who has to feel the guilt
all day, every day.
</p><timestamp>00:19:25</timestamp>
<p>So, you're the victim here?
</p><timestamp>00:19:27</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, and I know
that's not the woke, progressive,
intersectionally appropriate thing to say,
but I would say, yeah!
</p><timestamp>00:19:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm the one who has suffered the most
because of the actions of BoJack Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:19:36</timestamp>
<p><i>-You've </i>suffered?
-Yeah, I have!
</p><timestamp>00:19:38</timestamp>
<p><i>-The most?</i>
<i>-The most!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:19:39</timestamp>
<p>Really? More than, say, Sarah Lynn?
</p><timestamp>00:19:43</timestamp>
<p>Don't talk to me about her.
</p><timestamp>00:19:45</timestamp>
<p>No, I wanna know how <i>you're </i>the victim
of the Sarah Lynn story.
</p><timestamp>00:19:49</timestamp>
<p>-I'm serious.
-Explain to me...
how Sarah Lynn's overdose was
really rough for you.
</p><timestamp>00:19:53</timestamp>
<p>-Shut up.
-You feel a lot of guilt about that?
</p><timestamp>00:19:55</timestamp>
<p>You feel a lot of guilt because you were
the only father figure she ever had,
and when she came to you for help, you--
</p><timestamp>00:20:00</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, how you doing?
-You folks having a good time?
</p><timestamp>00:20:03</timestamp>
<p>You look great. Thanks for coming.
</p><timestamp>00:20:04</timestamp>
<p>-You had sex with her?
-That's-- ! No.
</p><timestamp>00:20:06</timestamp>
<p>And then when she was sober,
you took her on a month-long bender?
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p>And then she died. And she is dead now.
And you're still alive.
</p><timestamp>00:20:14</timestamp>
<p>With a girlfriend, who is also alive,
and a TV show.
</p><timestamp>00:20:17</timestamp>
<p>And that's been really hard for <i>you,</i>
the main character in this story.
</p><timestamp>00:20:21</timestamp>
<p>Why are you bringing this shit up?
Is this fun for you?
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>-To really rub in--
-It's not <i>fun.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:26</timestamp>
<p>You win! You scored all the points
in the argument!
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>According to facts, you are right
and I am wrong, like always.
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>But you know what? I don't care.
Because I'm trying to move forward.
</p><timestamp>00:20:35</timestamp>
<p>You haven't changed at all.
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>Yes! Congratulations!
You are the last person to get that.
</p><timestamp>00:20:39</timestamp>
<p>I'm not gonna <i>change.</i>
I don't need your <i>help</i> for <i>changing,</i>
so you can stop trying
to make me your project.
</p><timestamp>00:20:45</timestamp>
<p>-That's not--
-When I met you, I was depressed
because I didn't like myself.
</p><timestamp>00:20:49</timestamp>
<p>And when you wrote that book
and sold a bajillion copies,
you taught me that as screwed up
as I am, that's okay.
</p><timestamp>00:20:56</timestamp>
<p><i>You </i>did that. And now I'm okay.
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>I don't believe that's true.
</p><timestamp>00:21:01</timestamp>
<p>And I don't think you believe it's true.
</p><timestamp>00:21:04</timestamp>
<p>I think you want me to tell you
that you can be better.
</p><timestamp>00:21:08</timestamp>
<p>And even though you're being
a total asshole right now,
</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>I still believe it.
</p><timestamp>00:21:13</timestamp>
<p>If all you've gotten
out of this friendship,
is the idea that you should be okay
with yourself, as you are,
then I don't think
this is a good relationship...
for either of us.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>-Diane, come on.
-I'm going home.
</p><timestamp>00:21:24</timestamp>
<p>No, Diane, we're saying things,
but let's just go back to the party.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>I'm done... with all of this.
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>I went to New Mexico to see Charlotte.
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>She was married with a daughter.
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>But it wasn't like...
what you're thinking.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>She was 17, which is the legal age
of consent in New Mexico,
and she wasn't drunk, so,
not that I wanted to, I never... I didn't.
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>That's the dumbest part of all of this!
I didn't do anything.
</p><timestamp>00:21:46</timestamp>
<p>I mean, the fact that this has turned
into such a thing for you--
you know, maybe I didn't tell you
because there was nothing to tell.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>Did you ever think of that?
She was my friend's daughter,
and she wanted it, and I was... <subtitle>breathes</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>I was in a bad place
because Charlotte had just--
</p><timestamp>00:21:58</timestamp>
<p>So, then she came onto my boat,
Charlotte, I mean,
and she walked in,
and I was with her daughter.
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>But again, nothing had happened yet.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>-"Yet?"
-Nothing happened.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>Goodbye, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>-Diane, no!
-Hey-- Aah!
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>You wanted me to tell you. I told you.
You know everything.
</p><timestamp>00:22:12</timestamp>
<p>-Please let go of me.
-Diane, please.
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>You're hurting me,
and I would like you to let go now.

-<subtitle>Henry</subtitle> <i>More, more.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>Well, all ten episodes
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p>-will be on our website at midnight.
<i>-More.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>
<p>-You want more episodes?

</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>Ooh! Flip! They're picking us up
for more episodes!
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>Wow. And my mother said
I'd never last as long as <i>Hung.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>Well, who's <i>Hung </i>now, Mom?
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>

<p>Want me to drive you home?

<p>You can come back
and get your car tomorrow?
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>
<p>You don't have to do that.
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p>Of course not.
I don't have to do anything.

<p>Gina, I know it's early,
but have you started writing
your acceptance speech for the Emmys?
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p>Oh, stop. I'll probably just repurpose
whatever I say at the SAG Awards.

</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>Can you explain to your readers

<p>And, great job, by the way.
You're really good on the show.
</p><timestamp>00:24:09</timestamp>
<p>Yeah? No. Me? No. Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>Yeah! You're a good actor.
I never knew that about you.
</p><timestamp>00:24:16</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'll see you back on set, right?
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>
<p>Did you hear we got picked up
for more episodes?
</p><timestamp>00:24:20</timestamp>
<p>I'm not going back.
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Well, then,
I guess I'll see you around.

<p>I hope so. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>

<p>I can't believe I finally got you
to leave a party early.
</p><timestamp>00:24:30</timestamp>
<p>Come on, you know I'd do anything for you.
</p><timestamp>00:24:33</timestamp>
<p>-Why? I'm such a disaster.
-You're not a disaster.
</p><timestamp>00:24:38</timestamp>
<p>You're Diane. You're amazing.
