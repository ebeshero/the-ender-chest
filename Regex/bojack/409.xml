<p>It's Ruthie's turn
to present her ancestor.
</p><timestamp>00:00:18</timestamp>
<p>-Go ahead, Ruthie.

<p>My great-great-great grandmother
was called Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>She was an agent
and a manager in Hollywoo.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>What's the difference
between an agent and a manager?
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>Both look to find projects
for their clients
but only managers can produce.

</p><timestamp>00:00:37</timestamp>
<p>My mom told me that I come
from a long line of strong female cats.
</p><timestamp>00:00:41</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn was the runt of 12
and it made her one of the toughest.
</p><timestamp>00:00:45</timestamp>
<p>Mom said, "She could take a lickin'
and keep on tickin'."

<p>{\an8}Offers? Well, you tell them

</p><timestamp>00:03:21</timestamp>

<p>Got it. Busy, busy. I'm busy too,

<p>{\an8}-<i>Don't call. I don't work for you!</i>
-How's this for a headline for the blog?
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You write about this, quote,

<p>{\an8}I still don't understand your plan,

</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>The plan couldn't be simpler.

ask to see all the birth certificates
on file, find Hollyhock's,

<p>They're not just gonna give you

-I don't know. Just wanted some company.
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>

<p>{\an8}-I got your number!

<p>Not to speak above my station,

BoJack Horseman back into our stable.

<p>-Ugh!
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p>"Stable" and "behoove"
were poor word choices.

<p>I was not trying to engage in punnery
during business hours,
but we've received 15 more inquiries
about BoJack just this morning,
and I don't think it's wise to look
a gift... opportunity in the mouth.
</p><timestamp>00:07:31</timestamp>
<p>BoJack is off the table.

<p>First quarter, second quarter.
Wow, that's a lot of quarters.
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>Oh, excuse me. Hello.
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>Judah, you'll never guess
who I just ran into.
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>No, I won't. Very astute, ma'am.
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>-It was Charley Witherspoon!
-Mm-hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:11:02</timestamp>
<p>-Char... ley...
-Hmm...? Hmm!
</p><timestamp>00:11:05</timestamp>
<p>-Wither... spoon!
-Hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-How does that make you feel?
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>That very short story
makes me feel nothing.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>I don't think it's your fault
as a storyteller.
</p><timestamp>00:11:13</timestamp>
<p>I often have trouble engaging
with narratives.
</p><timestamp>00:11:15</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Ruthie</subtitle> <i>His lack of response</i>

</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p><i>Could it all have been a misunderstanding</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:20</timestamp>
<p><i>involving an enigmatic stranger</i>

</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>
<p>So, what's next, then?
</p><timestamp>00:11:25</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, I want to get the life rights
to that woman I saw on Instagram
who had a pretty coffee.
</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p>I bet we could attach Jessica Alba
and Jonathan Taylor-Thomas by lunch.
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>Okay, but I still don't understand
what a manager <i>is.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>Do they just say the names
of movies and actors?
</p><timestamp>00:11:39</timestamp>
<p>How does that generate revenue?
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>No one knows, Torf. It's not important!
</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p>Be quiet, Torf. Take your Hush Pill.
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>Yes, Miss Teach--
<subtitle>gulps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>Uh-hh...
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>-Continue your presentation, Ruthie.
-Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>-And finally, Rob Lowe.
-Great idea, Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>But is it possible you've forgotten
your doctor's appointment?
</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, fish!
-It's my fault.
</p><timestamp>00:12:00</timestamp>
<p>I rescheduled it in an attempt
to make your life easier.
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>Thank you, Judah! I'll call you

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...
</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>-God, this is taking forever.
-We've been waiting for 15 minutes.
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>I know. Let's just go home.
</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>
<p>No, Diane.
How could you even suggest that?
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>This is not about us.
This is for my daughter.
</p><timestamp>00:12:20</timestamp>
<p>-Ugh.
-I know what I have to do.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me.
</p><timestamp>00:12:23</timestamp>
<p>Important celebrity doing the right thing.
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa, a famous guy!
-And he's doing the right thing?
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>This is like when George Clooney
married that less famous lady!
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>-Wait. Don't you mean Jurj Clooners?
-Who cares?
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p>Hello, friend.
</p><timestamp>00:12:38</timestamp>
<p>-Yes, it's me, BoJack Hor--
-Number?
</p><timestamp>00:12:40</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, I don't give out
my personal phone number.
</p><timestamp>00:12:42</timestamp>
<p>No, your number. You need a number
or I can't help you, BoJack Hor.
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>Horseman. It's Horseman.
I don't look familiar to you at all?
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>-Eh.
-Come on, BoJack. Let's get a number.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>Wait a minute. You're Diane Nguyen!
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>I recognize you
from your <i>Girl Croosh </i>avatar.
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p>I loved "Twenty Reasons
to Try the Diva Cup."
</p><timestamp>00:13:00</timestamp>
<p>Oh, wow, thanks! You didn't think
20 was too many reasons?
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p>-No way. Number 14 blew my mind!
-Didn't I say it would?
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>
<p>We don't have time.
Where do we get a number?
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p>-That line.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:13:11</timestamp>
<p>And you'll need these-- <subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
forms.
</p><timestamp>00:13:14</timestamp>
<p>Ow, paper cut! Who still uses paper?
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>Can't I just swipe an app or something?
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>-Bye, Diane! Keep up the great work!
-<subtitle>giggles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:21</timestamp>
<p>Oh, get over yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:13:27</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
-<subtitle>door opens</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>-So? What's the prognosis?
-Hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p>I'm trying to think of the best way
to put this.
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>As Charles Lindbergh would say,
</p><timestamp>00:13:36</timestamp>
<p>"Sometimes you fly an airplane,
and sometimes you lose a baby."
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>In this case, you didn't fly the airplane.
</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>
<p>Wait, what?
</p><timestamp>00:13:42</timestamp>
<p>Your pregnancy is no longer viable.
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>Well, how do we make it viable again?
</p><timestamp>00:13:48</timestamp>
<p>Mm-mm...
</p><timestamp>00:13:49</timestamp>
<p>How did this happen?
</p><timestamp>00:13:50</timestamp>
<p>Goodness, I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>I wouldn't beat yourself up.
Miscarriages happen for so many reasons.
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>There's nothing medically wrong with you.
Maybe you just wanted the baby too much.
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>Maybe you didn't deserve it
because you were unkind once.
</p><timestamp>00:14:01</timestamp>
<p>Maybe you ran afoul of a trickster god
or wood nymph who is now exacting revenge.
</p><timestamp>00:14:05</timestamp>
<p>Oof!
This is... a lot.
</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>
<p>Not for me. This is my job,
so... pretty regular day.
</p><timestamp>00:14:11</timestamp>
<p>What do I do next?
</p><timestamp>00:14:13</timestamp>
<p>Well, there's a procedure.
We can do it here later this week.
</p><timestamp>00:14:15</timestamp>
<p>You want Darlene to call someone
to drive you home?
</p><timestamp>00:14:17</timestamp>
<p>No, I'm okay. I don't need anyone.
</p><timestamp>00:14:20</timestamp>
<p>You're a real tough broad.
Except for, you know, the uterus area.
</p><timestamp>00:14:24</timestamp>
<p>Pretty weak.
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, is my necklace ready?
-Oh, I was going to call you.
</p><timestamp>00:14:33</timestamp>
<p>When I was working on your necklace,
I realized something.
</p><timestamp>00:14:36</timestamp>
<p>-Oh?
-It's not actually gold,
it's just gold plated. See?
</p><timestamp>00:14:40</timestamp>
<p>No, it's very expensive.
</p><timestamp>00:14:43</timestamp>
<p>It's pretty, but basically worthless.
</p><timestamp>00:14:45</timestamp>
<p>And I'm only saying it's pretty
to make you feel better.
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>But, it's from the old country.
It's been in my family for generations.
</p><timestamp>00:14:52</timestamp>
<p>No, this is costume jewelry
from J.C. Penney.
</p><timestamp>00:14:55</timestamp>
<p>Circa 1963.
Somebody just told you a story.
</p><timestamp>00:14:59</timestamp>
<p>-I'm sorry.
-Wha-- huh?
</p><timestamp>00:15:01</timestamp>
<p>So, do you still want a 24-karat gold
clasp on this garbage necklace, or...?
</p><timestamp>00:15:08</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sniffles</subtitle> Oh-hh!
</p><timestamp>00:15:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gasps, sobs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>ringtone plays</subtitle>
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:15:25</timestamp>
<p>Ralph, hey!
</p><timestamp>00:15:26</timestamp>
<p>Hi, honey. Just checking
on how the doctor's appointment went
and also to wish you a happy
"Acknowledge Your Gardener Day."
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>It's a work in progress. Don't judge.
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p>The doctor's appointment got pushed back.
</p><timestamp>00:15:36</timestamp>
<p>I'm actually just walking in now.
</p><timestamp>00:15:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, hello. Yes, it's me, Princess Carolyn,
here for my appointment.
</p><timestamp>00:15:41</timestamp>
<p>I like your perfume.
</p><timestamp>00:15:43</timestamp>
<p>There is a painting of a lake on the wall.
</p><timestamp>00:15:45</timestamp>
<p>You sure it's okay I'm not there with you?
</p><timestamp>00:15:47</timestamp>
<p>Ralph, it's fine. I'm a big girl.
</p><timestamp>00:15:49</timestamp>
<p>Everything is so easy with you,
Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:15:51</timestamp>
<p>I mean, that's why I love you.
</p><timestamp>00:15:53</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, easy. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:55</timestamp>
<p>That's what the boys in high school
liked about me, too.
</p><timestamp>00:15:57</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
Okay, I'll see you tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:15:59</timestamp>
<p>-<i>I love you.</i>
-I love you, too.
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>beeps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:06</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>slurps, moans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:09</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I didn't realize you were still here.
Do you need anything else before I go?
</p><timestamp>00:16:12</timestamp>
<p>No. Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:14</timestamp>
<p>Should you be drinking that?
</p><timestamp>00:16:16</timestamp>
<p>You don't always know
what's best for me, Judah.
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>Is everything okay, Princess Carolyn?
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>Charley Witherspoon
made you an offer to buy Vim,
and you went over my head
and turned him down without telling me.
</p><timestamp>00:16:26</timestamp>
<p>Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:16:27</timestamp>
<p>-So it's true. You lied to me.
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>Because you didn't want to work
at a big agency.
</p><timestamp>00:16:32</timestamp>
<p>-You don't fit in with other people.
-I--
</p><timestamp>00:16:34</timestamp>
<p>You're weird, so you'd rather stay here
where you have all the power.
</p><timestamp>00:16:37</timestamp>
<p>No, Princess Carolyn--
</p><timestamp>00:16:39</timestamp>
<p>So you lied to me,
and you made me look like an idiot!
</p><timestamp>00:16:41</timestamp>
<p>I was trying to protect you. If you heard,
you'd feel like you had to say yes.
</p><timestamp>00:16:45</timestamp>
<p>I don't need you to protect me.
</p><timestamp>00:16:46</timestamp>
<p>If you had time, you could decide
what to do next
on your own terms, which you did.
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>Well, that's not your decision to make.
</p><timestamp>00:16:51</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn,
I understand you're upset.
</p><timestamp>00:16:53</timestamp>
<p>-And perhaps your emotions--
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:16:55</timestamp>
<p>If I can't trust you,
then I can't work with you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:57</timestamp>
<p>You're fired.
</p><timestamp>00:17:00</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:17:03</timestamp>
<p>Thank you for my time here,
Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:17:04</timestamp>
<p>It's been very pleasurable. Until now.
</p><timestamp>00:17:07</timestamp>
<p>This part is... sad.
</p><timestamp>00:17:11</timestamp>
<p>Don't forget,
you have reservations at 8:00.
</p><timestamp>00:17:13</timestamp>
<p>-Thank you, Judah.
-Good night.
</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>Ruthie, this story has gotten really dark.
</p><timestamp>00:17:21</timestamp>
<p>It has a happy ending. I promise.
</p><timestamp>00:17:23</timestamp>
<p>Well, can we get there soon?
</p><timestamp>00:17:24</timestamp>
<p>This assignment
was supposed to be six beans long.
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>You've already gone on for eight beans.
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>Okay. I'm almost finished.
</p><timestamp>00:17:31</timestamp>
<p>But first, let's check in
with BoJack and Diane again.
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>What have they been up to?
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>beeping</subtitle>
Error. Error.
</p><timestamp>00:17:38</timestamp>
<p>I'm not leaving
without the certificate!
</p><timestamp>00:17:40</timestamp>
<p>I danced your dance, lady.
I filled out that form.
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>But I will not wait in this line anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:17:44</timestamp>
<p>Not one person in here
offered me a Fiji water,
and I am parched
from all the yelling I've been doing!
</p><timestamp>00:17:50</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, let's go home.
</p><timestamp>00:17:52</timestamp>
<p>No, I would like to register
a formal complaint.
</p><timestamp>00:17:55</timestamp>
<p>-How do I do that?
-Complaints are on the eighth floor.
</p><timestamp>00:17:57</timestamp>
<p>But you need to fill out an application
for a complaint registration,
which you can get by waiting
in line 12-B on the third floor.
</p><timestamp>00:18:05</timestamp>
<p>You have won this round.
</p><timestamp>00:18:08</timestamp>
<p>So Princess Carolyn had to meet Ralph.
</p><timestamp>00:18:10</timestamp>
<p><i>But she didn't know how to tell him</i>
<i>what had happened</i>
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p><i>or how he'd take the news.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:18:15</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so, what do you think
about "National Paperweight Day"?
</p><timestamp>00:18:18</timestamp>
<p>"Thanks for keeping my papers in place.
I love you as big as outer space."
</p><timestamp>00:18:21</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so you'd give that card
to a paperweight?
</p><timestamp>00:18:25</timestamp>
<p><i>Ah, Principessa!</i> And <i>Signor </i>Stilton.
Welcome-a back.
</p><timestamp>00:18:29</timestamp>
<p>Let's have a drink then, yes?
</p><timestamp>00:18:30</timestamp>
<p>I'll have a glass
of Châteauneuf-du-Pape,
the red wine inspired by <i>Scandal.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>That Kerry Washington has really brought
red wine into popularity.
</p><timestamp>00:18:38</timestamp>
<p>It's a-funny,
because I thought that the <i>terroir</i>
of the Italian countryside did it.
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>-But, a-no, it's-a Miss Kerry Washington.
-Ugh.
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p>Everybody love-a Miss-a Kerry.
</p><timestamp>00:18:48</timestamp>
<p>And my gal pal here
would love some mint tea. Right?
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>-You know it.
<i>-Bene, bene.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:18:53</timestamp>
<p>How was the doctor?
He tell you the species?
</p><timestamp>00:18:55</timestamp>
<p>I can't stop thinking about squeezing
little Philbert's baby feet.
</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>-Aw-ww...
-<subtitle>Ruthie</subtitle> <i>She wanted to tell him.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:19:00</timestamp>
<p><i>But she also wanted to let him stay</i>
<i>in his beautiful hopeful reality,</i>

<p><i>a reality she herself had lived in</i>
<i>just hours before,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:19:08</timestamp>
<p><i>and to which she now longed</i>
<i>desperately to return.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:19:10</timestamp>
<p>Well, the doctor didn't have much info.
</p><timestamp>00:19:13</timestamp>
<p>You know how doctors are. But he did say
there's nothing wrong with me, so--
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>
<p>-Ah, Miss-a Carrie Underwood.
-Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:19:19</timestamp>
<p>-Miss-a Carey Mulligan.
-Agh!
</p><timestamp>00:19:21</timestamp>
<p>Miss-a Carey, first name Mariah,
right this-a way!
</p><timestamp>00:19:25</timestamp>
<p>-Ugh!

<p>-<subtitle>coughing</subtitle>
-Are you okay?
</p><timestamp>00:19:29</timestamp>
<p>-I have to go.
-Oh. Well, you want me to drive you?
</p><timestamp>00:19:31</timestamp>
<p>No, it's fine.
I'll just meet you at home.
</p><timestamp>00:19:34</timestamp>
<p>Hmm.

<p><subtitle>Ruthie</subtitle> <i>But when Princess Carolyn</i>

</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, hello, handsome.
-Oh, thank God!
</p><timestamp>00:21:18</timestamp>
<p>You didn't come home, didn't answer
your phone. I was worried.
</p><timestamp>00:21:21</timestamp>
<p>Aw, you was worried?
</p><timestamp>00:21:23</timestamp>
<p>Judah told me you might be here.
Did you fire him?
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p>That hipster Chewbacca,
always getting in my personal biz-natch.
</p><timestamp>00:21:29</timestamp>
<p>I didn't know you still had this place.
Why do you still have this place?
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>Okay, what? Third degree much?
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>-Have you been drinking?
-It's fine, okay?
</p><timestamp>00:21:38</timestamp>
<p>-I get to drink because baby went gone!
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>"Gone, baby, gone."
Like that Ben Affleck movie.
</p><timestamp>00:21:44</timestamp>
<p>That could be a sequel.
<i>Gone, Baby, Never Was. </i>Write that down.
</p><timestamp>00:21:47</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God, Princess Carolyn.
-It's okay! You know me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>I always land on my feet.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p>Take a lickin', keep tickin'.
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>Like a lollipop with Tourette's.
Write that down.
</p><timestamp>00:21:57</timestamp>
<p>So you were lying earlier at dinner?
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>
<p>Is that what you're upset about?
That I lied?
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>About losing the baby?
About keeping my apartment?
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>I lied? That's the big sad thing
that happened?
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>Trying to process
what you threw at me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>It's gonna be fine.
I'll be pregnant again in no time.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>I'm so sorry. Let me take you home.
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>-When you're ready to try again--
-I'm ready!
</p><timestamp>00:22:17</timestamp>
<p>I said I was ready.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>So we'll go back to the doctor,
maybe talk about other options.
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>I don't need other options.
My mother had 12 kids.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>My body was made for this.
We just gotta keep tick-tick-tickin'.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>I know you wanna do this on your own,
but you've had two miscarriages now, and--
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>-Five!
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:22:33</timestamp>
<p>I've had five miscarriages.
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>One last year, now one,
and three others before.
</p><timestamp>00:22:38</timestamp>
<p>-But it's whatever. It's okay.
-Why didn't you tell me?
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p>Are you kidding?
I don't want you looking at me like that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:45</timestamp>
<p>Like that! I know I can do this.
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>
<p>You can't keep stuff like this from me.
It's not okay.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>-It's not about you.
-It is. This is about us.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>You're not allowed to be mad at me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>-This is my bad day.
-It's our bad day.
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
<p>It's so easy for you...
to love me when everything's good.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>Princess Carolyn, I...
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>-Let me take you home.
-No.
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>You need to live in this.
You need to get used to this,
because if you're serious about having
a baby with me, this could happen again.
</p><timestamp>00:23:07</timestamp>
<p>Are you prepared for that?
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>This could happen five more times.
But I'm ready for that.
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p>Because I want this.
Do you want it that bad?
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>I just think we should
maybe talk about other options.
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Here's another option.
</p><timestamp>00:23:23</timestamp>
<p>-Get out of my apartment!
-I'm sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>Get out! Save it for your next girlfriend.
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>The one you can take home to your parents.
The one who's <i>easy.</i>

</p><timestamp>00:24:05</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. I started this all wrong.
How was your day?
</p><timestamp>00:24:09</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>moans</subtitle> Well--

</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p><i>I mean, truly, one for the books.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:24:14</timestamp>
<p>Because I'm a good guy
trying to do the right thing.
</p><timestamp>00:24:16</timestamp>
<p>First, I go for my breakfast Pinkberry,
which I had earned
because I had good intentions for today,
they're out of my favorite toppings!
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p><i>So I go across the street to Menchie's,</i>

</p><timestamp>00:24:24</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
Mm-hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:24:26</timestamp>
<p>At Menchie's, the stupid teen that
worked there raised her eyebrows at me.
</p><timestamp>00:24:29</timestamp>
<p>"You kidding me?
You're trying to judge me?
</p><timestamp>00:24:31</timestamp>
<p>You have very uneven eyebrows
and you work at a Menchie's."
</p><timestamp>00:24:33</timestamp>
<p><i>And don't even get me started</i>

<p>Hey, you wanna know what I do
when I have a really bad,
awful, terrible day?
</p><timestamp>00:24:42</timestamp>
<p><i>What?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:24:43</timestamp>
<p>I imagine my great-great-great
granddaughter in the future
talking to her class about me.
</p><timestamp>00:24:48</timestamp>
<p>She's poised and funny,
and tells people about me
and how everything worked out
in the end.
</p><timestamp>00:24:53</timestamp>
<p>And when I think about that,
</p><timestamp>00:24:55</timestamp>
<p>I think about how everything's
going to work out.
</p><timestamp>00:24:57</timestamp>
<p>Because how else could she tell people?
</p><timestamp>00:25:00</timestamp>
<p>But it's... fake.
</p><timestamp>00:25:03</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, well... it makes me feel better.
