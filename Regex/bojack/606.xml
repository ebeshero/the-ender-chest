<p>-Oh. Hello, Jorge.
-I have some news. It's about your mother.
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>Oh, is the news that you're marrying her,
inserting yourself into our family
and ruining my life?
</p><timestamp>00:03:22</timestamp>
<p>Because I already heard that news
like 25 years ago, Jorge.
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>-I didn't come to your home to fight.
-Then joke's on you
because you didn't come to my home at all.
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I just sleep on the couch...
-<subtitle>Jorge sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-...since you and Mom gave me the boot.
-That was ten years ago.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>Which, by the way,
is the only thing you ever gave me.
</p><timestamp>00:03:40</timestamp>
<p>I gave you my name,
and you have clearly wasted it.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Do you know what the Chavez name
stands for?
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yes, Jorge.
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>Chavez! C for cerebral!
H for high-minded! A for analytical!
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>V for veracious! E for efficacious!
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>And Z for zealously practical.
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p>Feels like a cheat on the Z.
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>Todd, your mother needs your help.
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>Well, then instead of sending her husband,
she should have asked me herself,
if it's so important to her.
</p><timestamp>00:04:06</timestamp>
<p>-She's in a coma.
-A rudeness coma?
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p>No, a regular coma.
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God! Why didn't you open with that?
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>Please. Your mother needs a kidney.
</p><timestamp>00:04:16</timestamp>
<p>I put her on the donor waiting list,
but if you're a match...
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>Oh. I'm sorry.
Of course I would give Mom my kidney.
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>-Then there's no time to waste--
-"Would" give her my kidney.
</p><timestamp>00:04:27</timestamp>
<p>"Would." You need to work
on your listening skills.
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>I sold my extra kidney just last week.
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Why?
-I wanted to buy these sock puppets.
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You sold your kidney for... <subtitle>groans</subtitle>
I'm sorry I came.
</p><timestamp>00:04:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}If you'd like to visit your mother--
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>

we got my kidney back?

</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>-You know it.
-This strike has shut down the whole city!
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>Assistants want respect?
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>If we respect them, how are we supposed
to work through our rage issues?
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p>On our spouses and children?
That doesn't seem fair.
</p><timestamp>00:05:13</timestamp>
<p>There's gotta be a better way!
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>Uh, maybe we could circumvent
giving the assistants what they want
by giving them what they think they want.
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>You know, like how we satiate TV creators
by giving them little vanity cards
at the end of episodes,
then sell the shows to streaming networks
that auto-skip the end credits
so no one even sees the vanity cards!
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that's good.
But what do assistants want?
iTunes gift cards? Amazon gift cards?
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>I honestly can't think of another thing
an assistant would want.
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>When I was an assistant,
the only thing I wanted
was not to be an assistant anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:06:07</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> No! That was outside!
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>Listen, I've been trying
to get in touch with you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>I got a call from this mental health
advocacy group.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>Those guys are jizzin' their pants
over your heroic admission
of your struggle with depression,
and they wanna help you
share your story with the world.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>The world, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:06:22</timestamp>
<p>I wanted to set up a meeting,
but my assistant went on strike,
and phones, for me, are, like, what?
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>Even if you had your assistant,
it wouldn't do any good.
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>My reps' assistants
are all on strike, too.
</p><timestamp>00:06:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh, bummer. Guess there's no way
to get in touch then.
</p><timestamp>00:06:36</timestamp>
<p>Too bad. I'd love to get together.
</p><timestamp>00:06:42</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:09:06</timestamp>
<p>-Hi, I'm Diane. This is Guy.

</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>Oh! Are you ready for introductions
or are you still processing
the whole being kidnapped
across state lines?
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, what?
</p><timestamp>00:09:15</timestamp>
<p>We're breaking
into the Whitewhale building.
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>-Why?
-To get back my kidney and save Mom
and prove to you
that I'm not just a wacky screw-up
who engages primarily
in goofy whimsical mess-arounds.
</p><timestamp>00:09:26</timestamp>
<p>-How did you get me on the plane?
-We did a <i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:09:31</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
-As I was saying,
tonight's the Whitewhale
employee holiday party.
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p>Security will be tight, but you can use
my employee ID to get in,
because I'm technically
still on the payroll.
</p><timestamp>00:09:39</timestamp>
<p>Wait, you didn't quit?
We haven't worked there in months.
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p>Nobody's noticed!
They keep sending me checks.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>Cashing them is my way of very gradually
taking down the man from the inside.
</p><timestamp>00:09:48</timestamp>
<p>Hey. C-- can we sidebar for a minute?
Is this really the best use of your time?
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>You've been beating yourself up
about how slowly the book's going. So...
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>But the book is about me
and my life, so by living my life,
</p><timestamp>00:09:58</timestamp>
<p>I am in fact working on the book.
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>You don't have to write this book
if you don't want to.
</p><timestamp>00:10:02</timestamp>
<p>Of course I want to.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>Okay. I'm just saying, since you started,
you've been pretty down.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>-Not yourself. Diane--
-Actually, pretty down is myself.
</p><timestamp>00:10:09</timestamp>
<p>Can we talk about this later?
We're being rude.
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you offer them
one of your fancy beers?
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>So, all we need to do
is get into the party,
figure out where the kidneys are,
find my kidney, and sneak out,
all without drawing attention
to ourselves.
</p><timestamp>00:10:24</timestamp>
<p>And be careful, because
if Jeremiah Whitewhale catches you,
he can legally murder you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>
<p>Now, can I get anyone an imperial stout?
</p><timestamp>00:10:30</timestamp>
<p>The barley was from Portland, Maine,
but the brewery is in Portland, Oregon!
</p><timestamp>00:10:33</timestamp>
<p>This plan is ludicrous.
</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>Hey, maybe instead
of criticizing everything
like you've done my entire life,
you can get on board?
</p><timestamp>00:10:40</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>

<p>-Um...
-Plus, your own assistant.
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p>-An... assistant?
-<subtitle>thunder rumbling</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p>-That is, of course, if the strike ends.
-<subtitle>giggles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>Well, that's a very generous offer,
but I'd have to talk it over
with my colleagues.
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>Why? Those are assistants.
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>You're not one of them anymore.
You're one of us.
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>It's a two-year contract.

<p>Can you tell me what it is?
</p><timestamp>00:12:06</timestamp>
<p>You wouldn't get it.

</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>I thought your last name was Nguyen.
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>-Oh! Uh, yeah, it is! Todd Nguyen.
-Not Diane Nguyen?
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yeah! Diane Nguyen.
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>That's me, all right,

</p><timestamp>00:14:24</timestamp>
<p>Doctor Champ, what is your plan?
</p><timestamp>00:14:26</timestamp>
<p>Just gotta drink enough to be steady.
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p>Then, you take me back to Pastiches
and keep me out of trouble.
</p><timestamp>00:14:31</timestamp>
<p>That way, you don't have to go home
and I can be a good therapy horse.
</p><timestamp>00:14:35</timestamp>
<p>All my clients get sober, I am a winner,
put my picture on a magazine. <subtitle>slurps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>Look, I can't let you go back there drunk.
</p><timestamp>00:14:41</timestamp>
<p>You don't care about me!
You're scared of this guy.
</p><timestamp>00:14:47</timestamp>
<p>You can't help anybody else
unless you're honest with yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>
<p>-Know what I mean?
-No. I never know what you mean.
</p><timestamp>00:14:53</timestamp>
<p>In fact, maybe I wouldn't be so scared
if you'd given me real therapy
over the last six months
instead of just plying me
with folksy aphorisms.
</p><timestamp>00:14:59</timestamp>
<p>I'm not a therapist! I'm a therapy horse,
a subtle but legally
important distinction.
</p><timestamp>00:15:04</timestamp>
<p>Besides, you wouldn't accept
real therapy from me.
</p><timestamp>00:15:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh, and why's that?
</p><timestamp>00:15:08</timestamp>
<p>Gee, I don't know,
maybe because I'm a horse,
so I remind you of your father,
so you simultaneously resent me
and crave my approval,
an approval which,
ironically, if granted--
</p><timestamp>00:15:17</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I would dismiss immediately
and then use as an excuse to resent you
even more, what's your point?
</p><timestamp>00:15:21</timestamp>
<p>My point is, you're stunted from having
healthy relationships with horses, idiot!
</p><timestamp>00:15:26</timestamp>
<p>Oh, really? Well, if that were true,
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>I would have almost
no other horses in my life.
</p><timestamp>00:15:30</timestamp>
<p>Right, it's almost as if all your friends
and loved ones
are humans or dogs or cats--
</p><timestamp>00:15:35</timestamp>
<p>But then how do you explain
the one horse I do care about,
my half-sister Hollyhock,
who is also a reminder of my father?
</p><timestamp>00:15:40</timestamp>
<p>If your theory were true,
wouldn't I keep her at arms' length,
desperate for her to love me
but unwilling to be vulnerable enough
to allow her to hurt me?
</p><timestamp>00:15:46</timestamp>
<p>You blockhead, she's not your father!
</p><timestamp>00:15:49</timestamp>
<p>Hollyhock reminds you
of the horse you hate the most. Yourself!
</p><timestamp>00:15:53</timestamp>
<p>Okay, you got me!
</p><timestamp>00:15:54</timestamp>
<p>My parents gave me an internalized
self-hatred of horses.
</p><timestamp>00:15:57</timestamp>
<p>So, my horse body is a prison
that I can never escape.
</p><timestamp>00:16:00</timestamp>
<p>This manifests in rotten behavior
because I subconsciously believe
I deserve to be punished,
but being famous, I'm never punished,
so I act out even more.
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>And since this pattern
is so woven into my identity,
it is unfathomable to me that it can
ever be curbed, so instead, I drink!
</p><timestamp>00:16:14</timestamp>
<p>Uh... Check, please!
</p><timestamp>00:16:16</timestamp>
<p>So, the only way I can progress
is to return to my life as a sober man
and finally hold myself accountable
for my actions, past and future.
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, is this what therapy is?
</p><timestamp>00:16:24</timestamp>
<p>Why do you keep bringing me checks?

</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>I was tough on you
because I expected big things from you.
</p><timestamp>00:17:21</timestamp>
<p>You weren't tough. You were mean.
</p><timestamp>00:17:23</timestamp>
<p>-Because the world is mean!

<p>I wanted to push you to be your best self.

</p><timestamp>00:17:31</timestamp>
<p>But you didn't fail me
because I am not a failure.
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>Look... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Okay, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:17:37</timestamp>

on your terms?

</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p>I suggest we adjourn for the day
and start in earnest tomorrow.
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>-On schedule?
-Um...
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>-Okay?
-Fabulous. Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>Judah.
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>-What the shell was that?
-Let the negotiations begin.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>

Todd, I, uh... owe you an apology.
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>-Oh?
-<subtitle>inhales, exhales</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>I know I was hard on you
when you were growing up,
but I was trying to protect you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>Nothing came easy for me.
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>It took hard work, focus, discipline
to get me where I am today.
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>Things didn't just work out.
</p><timestamp>00:22:45</timestamp>
<p>But I should have realized: you're white.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>I forgive you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p>She's awake.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>Do you wanna come say hello?
I'm sure she would love to see you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>Well, she has my number.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>-That's cold, Todd.
-What do you expect?
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm a Chavez, right?
</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p>Hmm...
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>-Huh? Where am I?
-You're at Partridges,
the rehab clinic
founded by Danny Bonaduce.
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>-What about Pastiches?
-I told them I was checking you in here.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>Why would you do that?
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p>Those people need me
to be an example of success.
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>You can't help anybody else
unless you're honest with yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>-A wise man told me that.
-Who? What wise man?
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>
<p>You did.
I was being poetic and you ruined it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:30</timestamp>
<p>Well, don't listen to me. I'm a drunk!
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. But the first step is admitting it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>You've destroyed me.
I can never go back to Pastiches now.
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>My husband will leave me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p>I promised him I would never drink again
after what happened to our daughter.
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p>Uh... What happened to your daughter?
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>You know nothing of my life
and you think you know what's best for me?
</p><timestamp>00:23:50</timestamp>
<p>The only reason I got drunk
in the first place
is because of your contraband vodka!
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p>-Well, yes, technically, that's true.
-Of course you did this to me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:57</timestamp>
<p>Because I cared about you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:59</timestamp>
<p>And you ruin people who care about you.
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>exhales</subtitle> Well, best of luck.
</p><timestamp>00:24:04</timestamp>
<p>I want you to remember this, BoJack.
I want you to remember what you did to me.
</p><timestamp>00:24:10</timestamp>
<p>I remember everything. I'm sober now.
