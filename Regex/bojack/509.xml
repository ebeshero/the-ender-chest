<p>-Talk to me, Philbert.
-Don't tell her a thing.
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>car horn</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>What did you do to your wife?
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>-She was gonna get us all killed.
-So you took care of it, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>I tried to stop him!
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>-Who?
-Fritz! He was hopped up on goof-berries.
</p><timestamp>00:00:33</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>pills rattling</subtitle>
-Agh!
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>-I think I shot him.
-<subtitle>Peanutbutter</subtitle> Agh!
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>What are you doing, Philbert? Oh-hh!
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>You shot your partner?
</p><timestamp>00:00:40</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle> Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>moans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:45</timestamp>
<p>-Cut! We're turning around for BoJack.
-<subtitle>bell ringing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p>All right! That was acting.
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>Hey, so, this has been real,
but since it's our last day,
it feels like maybe we should call it
on the whole us sleeping together thing.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>I don't usually keep dating co-stars
once we've wrapped.
</p><timestamp>00:00:59</timestamp>
<p>Would you say we're<i> co-stars?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I'm Philbert.
I'd say we're more like both in the cast?
</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, let's definitely
pump the brakes on this.
</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p>And we're set. Action!
</p><timestamp>00:01:09</timestamp>
<p>I had no choice.
He was strangling my wife!
</p><timestamp>00:01:10</timestamp>
<p>What did you do with the bodies?
</p><timestamp>00:01:12</timestamp>
<p>I-- It's all a blur.
It feels like a dream.
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>-Where are the bodies, Philbert?
-I buried them.
</p><timestamp>00:01:17</timestamp>
<p>-In the same place I'm gonna bury you.
-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:21</timestamp>
<p>-Right here.
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:01:23</timestamp>
<p>Kiss me, you smart, handsome renegade.
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p>There's no time for that now.
The nuclear missiles are coming.
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>Cut! That's a wrap
on<i> Philbert</i> Season One!
</p><timestamp>00:01:32</timestamp>
<p>Great work, everyone!
</p><timestamp>00:01:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I want you all to know
I'm proud of what I've done here.
</p><timestamp>00:01:37</timestamp>
<p>-See ya at the Peabody Awards!
-Great working with you. Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:01:40</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Princess Carolyn</subtitle>
Terrific job. Seriously...
</p><timestamp>00:01:42</timestamp>
<p>What the hell are goof-berries?
</p><timestamp>00:01:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>theme music playing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:43</timestamp>
<p>Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:02:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> I love the sign.
-You better.
</p><timestamp>00:02:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I basically had to go
through a whole pen on that thing.
</p><timestamp>00:02:54</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-Hey, I'd help you with your bag,
</p><timestamp>00:02:56</timestamp>
<p>-but you know, my back.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:02:58</timestamp>
<p>It's cool that you came
through Los Angeles on your way home.
</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I guess we got lucky.
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The only flight from Connecticut to Kansas
had a one-night layover in California.
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Really?
-No, dummy. I wanted to see you.

</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Blunt?
<i>-Well, she is a little curt.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That's my Emily! Send her in!
</p><timestamp>00:03:21</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, Todd. <subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
-You okay?
</p><timestamp>00:03:23</timestamp>
<p>-I broke up with my fireman.
-Not Steve!
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>No, no, no, not Steve. It was Doug.
</p><timestamp>00:03:28</timestamp>
<p>Not Doug! Forgot there was a new one!
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>I am so done
with these sexy noble hero hunks.
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>The sex is great,
but the emotional connection
just is not there.
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>It was the same with me and Yolanda.
</p><timestamp>00:03:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No emotional connection,
but the no-sex was amazing.
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}None of the best sex I ever had.
</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You know,
I was actually thinking about that.
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Remember that idea you had
about the dating app for asexuals?
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Nope!
-<subtitle>phone clicking</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yeah, here we go. <music> Ta-da-da-da!</music>
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Todd</subtitle> "All About That Ace"?
</p><timestamp>00:03:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You should get yourself out there.
You were the best boyfriend I ever had.
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}If only there was a version of you
I could have sex with, I'd be all set.
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>-Whoa, Emily. I just got a crazy idea.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:04:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A restaurant where the menus
are printed on garlic bread,
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so after you order,
the first course is the menu!
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>clock ticking</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>So, ever since<i> Philbert </i>wrapped
earlier today,
the question on everybody's mind is,
</p><timestamp>00:04:28</timestamp>
<p>"What's Mr. Peanutbutter
going to do next?"
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>You're a serious actor now,
so I guess, narrate a documentary
about global warming,
and then take a private jet
to the premiere?
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>I've been looking for new projects.
</p><timestamp>00:04:40</timestamp>
<p>Seems like everything's based
on books these days,
so I went to the book store
to scout some material.
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>-Mm-hmm.
-But all the books are so long now.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah?
-Who has the time?
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>I'll just wait 'til the movie comes out,
then see the movie,
and decide if the book the movie
is based on would make a good movie.
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's a good strategy.
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, I was heading to the door
in book-length-related frustration...
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>...when I saw
one of those circular greeting card racks.
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>Spotted a card that looked interesting,
and it's a super-quick read.
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>flutters</subtitle>
-Eh...?
</p><timestamp>00:05:09</timestamp>
<p>-"Happy Birthday, Dad."
-Pretty cool dad, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>You want to option this greeting card
for a movie?
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>-We'll call it <i>Birthday Dad.</i>
-But what is it?
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>Hmm? Mmm... it's... "Birthday Dad."
</p><timestamp>00:05:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:05:24</timestamp>
<p>-You think we can get the film rights?
-I'll look into it.
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>moans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>giggles</subtitle> So, then Joby was like,
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>"Uh, nice scrunchie, Professor."
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>
<p>It was literally a thing.
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>Joby is the guy in your dorm
who plays guitar?
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, he's really funny,
but like soulful funny, you know?
</p><timestamp>00:05:43</timestamp>
<p>-That's great.
-Oh...!
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> You know, I always thought
I would make a good college person.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>Roaming the campus,
sticking it to the crusty old dean
with my rowdy 'tude,
having friends, and learning things,
and just, uh, being young.
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
-You okay?
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>You look as if you saw <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>
and you're Scarlett Johansson's publicist.
</p><timestamp>00:06:05</timestamp>
<p>It's weird to be back in this house.
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>This is where it all happened
with your mom.
</p><timestamp>00:06:10</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, this is so weird.
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>Hollyhock, whoa. It's okay.
That's ancient history.
</p><timestamp>00:06:15</timestamp>
<p>My mom is dead, so nobody is going
to drug you with secret pills. All right?
</p><timestamp>00:06:19</timestamp>
<p>Now, how about we make new, fun, memories
to cancel out the old ones?
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p>-Can the new memories be pizza-related?
-No doy!
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>Ah, thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p>It's nice to see you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure Fridays
must be a big night for you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>You were probably planning on going out
to a nice dinner with your new girlfriend?
</p><timestamp>00:06:39</timestamp>
<p>Or seeing a movie
with your new<i> girlfriend?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>Or staying in and watching cable--
</p><timestamp>00:06:44</timestamp>
<p>I get what you're asking. The answer is,
no, I don't have cable anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:06:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh! <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>Or a new girlfriend.
</p><timestamp>00:06:50</timestamp>
<p>I'm not seeing anyone either.
I've just been so busy with my<i> Philbert.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>
<p>Philbert? You have a Philbert?
</p><timestamp>00:06:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry. It's a show I'm producing.
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>Not the baby we really wanted
but never had.
</p><timestamp>00:07:00</timestamp>
<p>Oh, well, that's great, too.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, Mr. Peanutbutter wants
to option this card as a movie.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p><i>-Birthday Dad.</i>
-How is it a movie?
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>-Hmm. It's "Birthday Dad."
-Oh. Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:07:13</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>ringtone playing</subtitle>
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>-I'm sorry.
-Yeah. Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:07:18</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>phone beeps</subtitle>
-Hello?
</p><timestamp>00:07:19</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Tracy</subtitle> <i>Can you get to the St. Bernard</i>
<i>Medical Center in like, a half hour?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>Uh, I think so. Why?
</p><timestamp>00:07:24</timestamp>
<p><i>I just got my tonsils taken out,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p><i>-and I need a ride home.</i>
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:07:28</timestamp>
<p>Nah, I'm just messing with you.
A pregnant lady doesn't want the baby.
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>If you can get there tonight,
the baby's yours.
</p><timestamp>00:07:34</timestamp>
<p>Tonight? That's so--
she doesn't even know me.
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>Hey, man. You don't say no to free baby.
</p><timestamp>00:07:39</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>Is everything okay?
</p><timestamp>00:07:42</timestamp>
<p>I have to drive my hospital
to the car right now!
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>I'm a baby,
and there's adopting on the way!
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>-You're adopting?
-Vroom-vroom!
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>There's so much food in my lap!
Doesn't matter! It's fine!
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>-All part of being a mother!
-You are really freaking out.
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>Am I freaking out too much? Or not enough?
</p><timestamp>00:07:55</timestamp>
<p>-Let me drive you.
-But I have the car seat in my car.
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>They won't let you go home without one.
It's the only rule, really.
</p><timestamp>00:08:00</timestamp>
<p>There should be more rules,
but who am I to judge?
</p><timestamp>00:08:03</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>breathing heavily</subtitle>
-Hey, breathe.
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>I'll get the car seat. Let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:08:08</timestamp>
<p>Ugh. I ate too much.
</p><timestamp>00:08:10</timestamp>
<p>I need ice cream
to smoosh the rest of it down.
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I don't keep junk food in the house,
ever since last night
when I ate all of my ice cream.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>Hey, why do you have a vodka bottle
for every day of the week?
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that's just my new system I'm trying.
I'm down to one bottle a day.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>-Is this like an AA thing?
-No, I don't need AA.
</p><timestamp>00:08:26</timestamp>
<p>-Would you get outta there?
-I want ice cream.
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>-Give me your keys.
-What? No.
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>-Come on. Let me drive the Tesla.
-With your greasy pizza fingers?
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p>-Forget it.
-Come on! <subtitle>giggling</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:35</timestamp>
<p>-Hey.
-Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p>What the hell are these?
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>What? Oh, those...
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>Why was this in your pocket?
Are these for me?
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>No, Hollyhock. God, no.
</p><timestamp>00:08:43</timestamp>
<p>Oh God, did you put this in my pizza?
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>What? Of course not. Hollyhock.
No. Give me the-- no!
</p><timestamp>00:08:49</timestamp>
<p>-Oops.
-Hollyhock, those were for my back!
</p><timestamp>00:08:52</timestamp>
<p>-Wait, for real?
-Yes.
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>Oh, then actually, oops.
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>lock clicks</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, Todd. Is everything okay?
-I need to talk to someone,
and you're the only person I knew
would be available on a Friday night,
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>-with nothing to do.
-Hey, I almost went to the movies tonight!
</p><timestamp>00:09:11</timestamp>
<p>It's not my fault there's never anything
in the 8:00 hour.
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>9:15 is too late. 7:00 is too early.
When am I supposed to eat dinner?
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>Uh, sneak in a bag of mashed potatoes
like the rest of us?
</p><timestamp>00:09:21</timestamp>
<p>-Is this your whole apartment?
-It's a studio.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>I ate lunch with a studio head
just yesterday.
</p><timestamp>00:09:26</timestamp>
<p>-This is <i>not </i>a studio.
-What do you need, Todd?
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>Well, my friend, Emily,
did something really nice for me,
and I wanna pay her back.
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p>-Thought you could help me brainstorm.
-Okay. What kind of things does she like?
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>Well, sex, for one.
</p><timestamp>00:09:39</timestamp>
<p>Good for her!
A woman needs to know her own body
before she expects someone else
to know her body.
</p><timestamp>00:09:43</timestamp>
<p>-What? What are we talking about?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:09:45</timestamp>
<p>I think sex, for one?
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh! Diane, you sad-homed genius.
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p>-You've cracked it!
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:09:51</timestamp>
<p>To the junkyard
behind the engineering school!
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>-Always happy to contribute!

<p><subtitle>rattling</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:59</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I freaked out.
-It's not your fault.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>Your generation's been brainwashed
by McGruff the Crime Dog.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>Who, by the way, I met at a party once?
Didn't ask me a single question about me.
</p><timestamp>00:10:09</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, and also
because of the time I overdosed on pills.
</p><timestamp>00:10:12</timestamp>
<p>Right, well, these were good pills.
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>I told you I'm on a system now.
I'm not "doing drugs." This was medicine.
</p><timestamp>00:10:18</timestamp>
<p>Can you get more?
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>Oh, sure.
I'll just call the pharmacy and say,
</p><timestamp>00:10:21</timestamp>
<p>"Hey, girl, you know
that highly-addictive opioid
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>I'm supposed to take every three hours?
Well, I kind of misplaced them,
so could I just get some more?
I'm totally not a drug addict."
</p><timestamp>00:10:29</timestamp>
<p>-I'm really sorry.
-No. It's fine.
</p><timestamp>00:10:31</timestamp>
<p>Let's enjoy our time together,
even though I'm in tremendous pain.
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>I'll try to forget it,
but the whole time
we might be thinking about it.
</p><timestamp>00:10:37</timestamp>
<p>I do not blame you, but if you
blame yourself, that is okay with me.
</p><timestamp>00:10:40</timestamp>
<p>You must know a place
you can get more painkillers.
</p><timestamp>00:10:43</timestamp>
<p>I do know a guy,
but he's somewhat "south of Pico,"
if you know what I mean.
</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>
<p>I don't. Why do Los Angeles people think
everyone else understands
your local references?
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>Okay, okay, let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:10:56</timestamp>
<p>I can't believe you're adopting.
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>I just realized
it was the right thing for me.
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>I just remember you were so adamant
about having the baby yourself,
even when I said we should talk
about other options.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, but the way you said it--
-I'm not mad.
</p><timestamp>00:11:07</timestamp>
<p>I just think it's funny you had
that change of heart <i>after </i>we broke up.
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:12</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> I'm sorry. This is not about me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:15</timestamp>
<p>You'll be a great mom,
and I'm really happy for you.
</p><timestamp>00:11:17</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah?
-Of course.
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>Well, one day,
you're gonna be a great dad.
</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>
<p>-Hopefully as cool as Birthday Dad!
<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>-Why are we at the pediatrician?
-Trust me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p>This doctor is the sleaziest, dopiest,
scurviest of the scurvy.
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>-Who is he?
-Exactly.

<p>-<subtitle>Hollyhock yelps</subtitle>
-Hu... wants to par-tay?
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p>Dr. Hu! Thank you for squeezing us in!
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>You always gotta make time
for your friends.
</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p>And I haven't seen you
since Sarah Lynn's funeral.
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>Oh, right.
</p><timestamp>00:11:46</timestamp>
<p>That was a huge wake-up call for me.
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>Next morning I looked in the mirror,
and you know who I saw staring back at me?
</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Hollyhock</subtitle> Who?
-Exactly.
</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-No. Hu.
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>I spent 30 days at Pastiches Malibu
and now I'm sober.
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>It's like I completely regenerated
as a brand-new doctor.
</p><timestamp>00:12:02</timestamp>
<p>Congratulations.
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>
<p>You'd have to be a real lost cause
not to seek help
after losing Sarah Lynn like that,
don't you think?
</p><timestamp>00:12:09</timestamp>
<p>Oh, deffo. I mean, you know, get help
or, you know,
work out a system on your own.
</p><timestamp>00:12:13</timestamp>
<p>Even, you know, whatever's right for you.
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, I'm trying to get my hands
on some Feelbetterin?
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p>Feelbetterin?
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, have you been taking
oxypraxylcortizoid?
</p><timestamp>00:12:21</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I know what you're thinking,
but I legitimately have a herniated disc.
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>He's telling the truth!
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>I threw out his pills because of my trauma
from when I got drugged by his mama.
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>-You got drugged by your own mother?
-No, my mother.
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>Her mother was a maid
who got knocked up by my dad,
but she got adopted by eight other dads.
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p>Okay, do you know how many times
I hear this story every week?
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p>This story, specifically?
Even the "eight dads" part?
</p><timestamp>00:12:42</timestamp>
<p>I don't know who you think you're fooling,
but this Hu won't get fooled again.
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>Thank you for coming, Emily.
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>What's with all the candles?
Why are you wearing a robe?
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I blew a fuse earlier,
so I had to light candles.
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>That took a while,
and then I didn't get to change.
</p><timestamp>00:13:00</timestamp>
<p>-Oh.
-Hold that thought.
</p><timestamp>00:13:02</timestamp>
<p>-The thought of "Oh"?
-That's right.
</p><timestamp>00:13:04</timestamp>
<p>Because you're gonna need it
when you meet your new best friend...
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>

<p>So, you can stop dating
all those boring guys and still have sex!
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>-Stop me if you've heard this one. What?
-And guess what?
</p><timestamp>00:13:22</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:13:36</timestamp>

<p>That is so condescending.

</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>

<p>-I'm really sorry.

</p><timestamp>00:14:05</timestamp>
<p>We're spending time together,
that's all that matters.
</p><timestamp>00:14:07</timestamp>
<p>You're not super-mad at me, still?
</p><timestamp>00:14:09</timestamp>
<p>When this is done,
maybe it'll make a great story
you can tell that kid you have a crush on.
</p><timestamp>00:14:13</timestamp>
<p>Who, Joby? <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
I don't have a crush on him.
</p><timestamp>00:14:16</timestamp>
<p>Get out of here.
His jawline is, like, dumb.
</p><timestamp>00:14:19</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, okay.
-Where are we going now?
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>There's this actress I was kind of seeing
while we were working together
and I might have left some pills
at her place.
</p><timestamp>00:14:27</timestamp>
<p>She made it clear she doesn't want
to see me again but she's not home now.
</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p>-Why do I know Gina's schedule?
-Where is she?
</p><timestamp>00:14:32</timestamp>
<p>She has a book club with dumb Nicole
who keeps picking very long Italian books
that Nicole doesn't even read.
Why do I know about Gina's friends?
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>-Do you have a key?
-I have my ways.
</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>-Well, I'm out of ways.
-I'll go around back
and see if there's a window
I can climb through.
</p><timestamp>00:14:48</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, good thinking! I'll stand guard.
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:14:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God! What happened to book club?
</p><timestamp>00:14:57</timestamp>
<p>We switched it to Thursdays
to confuse Nicole.
</p><timestamp>00:14:59</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:15:09</timestamp>
<p>I just-- I need to talk to you.
</p><timestamp>00:15:11</timestamp>
<p>Slowly.
</p><timestamp>00:15:12</timestamp>
<p>Is this about our relationship?
What is there to talk about?
</p><timestamp>00:15:15</timestamp>
<p>Well, I just been thinking that...
we should<i> keep looking</i>
at this relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:15:20</timestamp>
<p>Like<i> all</i> parts of this relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:15:23</timestamp>
<p>Like even in the <i>junk drawer,</i>
<i>in the kitchen </i>of this relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:15:26</timestamp>
<p>-Or <i>the bathroom cabinet.</i>
-I told you I didn't want to see you.
</p><timestamp>00:15:30</timestamp>
<p>I want you to know
that you are top-shelf, Gina.
</p><timestamp>00:15:33</timestamp>
<p>-Know what I mean? <i>Top shelf.</i>
-So, what, you wanna get back together?
</p><timestamp>00:15:37</timestamp>
<p>-Eh...?
-Yes!
</p><timestamp>00:15:38</timestamp>
<p>Wait, really?
</p><timestamp>00:15:39</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, I gotta run.
-BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:15:40</timestamp>
<p>I have had 28 on-set flings,
and no guy has ever come to my house
after shooting was over to try
to have a real relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:15:47</timestamp>
<p>-Well...
-I guess I sort of internalized the idea
</p><timestamp>00:15:49</timestamp>
<p>I didn't deserve that?
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, but like I said, I really gotta run.
</p><timestamp>00:15:52</timestamp>
<p>But maybe I do deserve it.
Maybe we both do.
</p><timestamp>00:15:55</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, is it possible that we're the ones
we've been waiting for?
</p><timestamp>00:15:58</timestamp>
<p>Uh, yes. I totally think that is possible,
which is why I can't wait
to talk about this tomorrow!
</p><timestamp>00:16:03</timestamp>
<p>-What? Where are you going?
-I'll call you!
</p><timestamp>00:16:05</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Hollyhock panting</subtitle> Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:16:08</timestamp>
<p>Think I need to call her,
or did I leave things open enough
</p><timestamp>00:16:10</timestamp>
<p>-where I can kinda ghost?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:16:12</timestamp>
<p>Kidding! I'll call her.
I'm very fond of that woman.
</p><timestamp>00:16:15</timestamp>
<p>And I'm sure
that things are gonna work out fine,
and we can find a way to be happy together
and I won't hurt her
in a way that she carries with her
for the rest of her life.
</p><timestamp>00:16:22</timestamp>
<p>-Uh, okay.
-Lemme get them pills.
</p><timestamp>00:16:25</timestamp>
<p>-What the hell? These aren't my pills!
-Sorry!
</p><timestamp>00:16:27</timestamp>
<p>-Not your fault. It's just... my back.
</p><timestamp>00:16:31</timestamp>
<p>-I got another idea.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:16:33</timestamp>
<p>-Do you think Gina needed those?
-She'll be fine. Nobody<i> needs</i> pills.
</p><timestamp>00:16:40</timestamp>
<p>-You could've just dropped me off.
-I wanted to be here.
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>
<p>-Hope that's okay.
-It's actually nice you're here.
</p><timestamp>00:16:45</timestamp>
<p>All the times I imagined us
taking home a baby from the hospital,
</p><timestamp>00:16:48</timestamp>
<p>I never pictured it like this.
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>You mean, you never pictured
it would happen on a Friday?
</p><timestamp>00:16:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Yeah, exactly.
That's the main difference.
</p><timestamp>00:16:56</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> How come you never called me
after I kicked you out of my apartment?
</p><timestamp>00:17:00</timestamp>
<p>You were so mad at me.
I didn't think you wanted me to.
</p><timestamp>00:17:02</timestamp>
<p>I didn't.
But you still should have called.
</p><timestamp>00:17:05</timestamp>
<p>-Well, you could have called me.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:17:08</timestamp>
<p>-I wish you'd stayed with me that night.
-You told me to leave.
</p><timestamp>00:17:11</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I guess the lesson is,
don't listen to me, right?
</p><timestamp>00:17:14</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Ralph chuckles</subtitle> Mm-hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:17:16</timestamp>
<p>Is that really what you're gonna wear
for the first time your new baby sees you?
</p><timestamp>00:17:19</timestamp>
<p>-Yes?
-Oof! Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:17:25</timestamp>
<p>I'm supposed to be back
at the airport in, like, two hours.
</p><timestamp>00:17:29</timestamp>
<p>Is this really
how you want to spend this time?
</p><timestamp>00:17:31</timestamp>
<p>Again, and... <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
I hate to keep harping on this,
we wouldn't be here
if someone hadn't dumped my medicine.
</p><timestamp>00:17:36</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:18:03</timestamp>
<p>And please, talk into my lollipop.
</p><timestamp>00:18:05</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, this guy's a cop.
-I assure you I am not.
</p><timestamp>00:18:08</timestamp>
<p>He's just saying that
because earlier I said he was a cop.
</p><timestamp>00:18:11</timestamp>
<p>No. You can see the outline of his badge
under his tee-shirt!
</p><timestamp>00:18:15</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, no, he's definitely a cop.
-Seems cool to me.
</p><timestamp>00:18:18</timestamp>
<p>Listen. If I were a cop,
</p><timestamp>00:18:20</timestamp>
<p>I'd have pancake breath
from the precinct's

you waste so much time

</p><timestamp>00:19:16</timestamp>

then you could spend more time with me.

</p><timestamp>00:19:31</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. What would it be like?
</p><timestamp>00:19:33</timestamp>
<p>I guess we'd hang out together,
like we already do.
</p><timestamp>00:19:35</timestamp>
<p>And you would be my favorite person,
like you already are.
</p><timestamp>00:19:38</timestamp>
<p>And when something good happened to me,
like if I got a promotion at work,
you'd be the first person I'd tell,
and you'd smile and say,
"That's my boyfriend."
</p><timestamp>00:19:48</timestamp>
<p>Well, that could be cool.
But then I would have sex with the robot?

</p><timestamp>00:20:07</timestamp>
<p>-Okay. Well, you got any other ideas?
-Hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:20:13</timestamp>
<p>What about if marbles were cube-shaped,
so they don't roll away as much?
</p><timestamp>00:20:18</timestamp>
<p>-No dice.
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:22</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Princess Carolyn</subtitle> Oh, he's beautiful.
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>Do you think I'm terrible
for giving him away?
</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>
<p>What? Of course not.
</p><timestamp>00:20:29</timestamp>
<p>I don't know the first thing
about being a parent.
</p><timestamp>00:20:31</timestamp>
<p>-Bridget, it's okay.
-Your baby's in excellent hands.
</p><timestamp>00:20:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm just so glad he's going
to a good home,
</p><timestamp>00:20:36</timestamp>
<p>-with a mother and a father.
-What's this, now?
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>I mean, if my boyfriend was still
in the picture, maybe I could be a parent,
but as is, I think the baby's
probably better off with you two.
</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, no, Ralph's not--
-That's right!
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>We're gonna make
a wonderful family together.
</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>-Ralph, don't lie to her.
-I'm not lying.
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>
<p>A year ago, we wanted to have
a family together.
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>-I still want that.
-Ralph, no. You should go.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>I hear you say that, but I'm not making
the mistake I made last time.
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>I don't want this.
</p><timestamp>00:21:01</timestamp>
<p>This seems like a subject
you should have agreed on
before you came to the hospital.
</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>We can do this. Nothing has changed.
</p><timestamp>00:21:07</timestamp>
<p>I changed! I have plans now,
and you're not in them.
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>-You don't need to do this by yourself.
-I never needed to. I <i>want </i>to.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>I'm not afraid of how hard it's gonna be.
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>I already love this baby.
And that gives me so much power.
</p><timestamp>00:21:21</timestamp>
<p>I don't need anything else.
</p><timestamp>00:21:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, I just realized something.
</p><timestamp>00:21:26</timestamp>
<p>If you can do it by yourself,
maybe that means I can do it by myself.
</p><timestamp>00:21:29</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-No, no, Bridget, you definitely can't.
</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>I thought I couldn't.
But that speech you gave was so inspiring.
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p>It made me realize that all I need
to be a good mother is love.
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>Actually, you need <i>so </i>much more than that.
I was wrong when I said that a second ago.
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Okay. But for real,
give me my baby boy.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>moans</subtitle> Oh-hh...
-Coochie-coochie-choo...
</p><timestamp>00:21:51</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>moans</subtitle>
-Princess Carolyn, you are amazing.
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>-Can you be <i>my </i>mom?
-<subtitle>groans</subtitle> Oh-hh!

There's gotta be another way to get pills.
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>How about calling this Joby?
He sounds like a druggie.
</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p>-I thought your back hurts.
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>-How did you lift me over the fence?
-Well, the adrenaline kicked in.
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>-Do you <i>really </i>need these pills?
-Hollyhock, how many times--
</p><timestamp>00:22:14</timestamp>
<p>I'm just saying,
is it possible maybe you don't--
</p><timestamp>00:22:16</timestamp>
<p>Okay. You go to college
and suddenly you're so sophisticated,
</p><timestamp>00:22:20</timestamp>
<p>-and I'm a dumb junkie, is that it?
-What? No!
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>You don't understand anything!
</p><timestamp>00:22:23</timestamp>
<p>-I am in pain.
-No, I get that.
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>All the time. my whole life.
And you have no idea.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>So, sorry that you had one bad experience
with my mom,
but I have been in pain my whole life.
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>I think you should take me to the airport.
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:22:46</timestamp>
<p>-You're sure I can't drive you home?
-No, Ralph.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>Can I at least wait with you for the cab?
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>buckle clicks</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>So, I guess I'll see you later.
</p><timestamp>00:23:07</timestamp>
<p>-Hollyhock, I'm sorry.
-Me, too.
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>Maybe, it's possible that I don't...
</p><timestamp>00:23:13</timestamp>
<p>100-percent need-need the pills.
</p><timestamp>00:23:17</timestamp>
<p>I thought I did, but-- yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:19</timestamp>
<p>So, thank you for... caring about me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>I could take a semester off,
if you need someone--
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>No. God, no. Stay... stay in school.
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p>And take your classes, and kiss boys,
and do the college thing.
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna be fine.
I get it. Drugs are bad.
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>Not all drugs.
</p><timestamp>00:23:40</timestamp>
<p>Obviously, if you get hurt again,
and a doctor, a real doctor
prescribes you painkillers,
you can take them.
</p><timestamp>00:23:46</timestamp>
<p>-But only if you get hurt again.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:23:48</timestamp>
<p>-You promise?
-Yes. I promise.
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>Okay. I love you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:23:57</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Bye.
