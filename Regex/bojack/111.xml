</p><timestamp>00:00:13</timestamp>
<p>Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:00:14</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> <i>Okay, how about this one?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:16</timestamp>
<p>BoJack swallowed a dozen
pastries in the time it took
the caterer
to unwrap a fruit tray.
</p><timestamp>00:00:20</timestamp>
<p>When she asked where
the pastries had gone,
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>BoJack claimed he had no idea,
spraying her with
bits of buttery crust?
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
I did that once.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>Oh, but with holiday cookies.
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>I had sprinkles
all over my sweater.
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>See?
People respond
to the flawed portrait
I painted of you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>They see themselves in it.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>Why do you love Secretariat?
</p><timestamp>00:00:41</timestamp>
<p>Uh, because he was awesome?
</p><timestamp>00:00:42</timestamp>
<p>No, because he was flawed.
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, when people find
out that someone like you,
who seems larger than life,
is actually just as wounded
and vulnerable as they are,
it makes them feel less lonely.
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>Ugh, no!
Maybe that's what flawed,
sad fatties want
from other celebrities,
but for BoJack Horseman,
they want a heroic horse-stud
who is awesome
and who can save them from
their flawed, sad, fatty lives.
</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p>- You're so wrong.
- Actually, you know what?
</p><timestamp>00:01:06</timestamp>
<p>Now that I think about it,
I think that you're so wrong!
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p>Listen, we all agree
Diane broke contract
by leaking
the first two chapters,
but the response
has been amazing!
</p><timestamp>00:01:16</timestamp>
<p>People want to read more,
and we have to
get this to the printers
by the end of the week,
because that's when
the repo men are coming
to take away our printers.
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>The end of the week?
No!
</p><timestamp>00:01:25</timestamp>
<p>Okay, what if I told you
that I could have
a new book for you by then?
</p><timestamp>00:01:28</timestamp>
<p>- What?
- Yeah, a better one.
</p><timestamp>00:01:31</timestamp>
<p>Better stories,
better told, by me--
straight from the horse's mouth.
</p><timestamp>00:01:34</timestamp>
<p>You're gonna write
a whole book in five days?
</p><timestamp>00:01:37</timestamp>
<p>When's the last time
you even read a book?
</p><timestamp>00:01:39</timestamp>
<p><i>The Firm</i>, by John Grisham?
</p><timestamp>00:01:40</timestamp>
<p>Oh, do you think
what you do is so hard?

"Oh, I'm a writer.
</p><timestamp>00:01:45</timestamp>
<p>I go to coffee shops
with my laptop and my notebook
and my dumb glasses
that I have to wear,
because I'm so important
I need to see clearly."
</p><timestamp>00:01:54</timestamp>
<p>Well, I wish you
the best of luck.
</p><timestamp>00:01:55</timestamp>
<p>You know what
your problem is?
</p><timestamp>00:01:56</timestamp>
<p>You think you're so much
smarter than everybody.
</p><timestamp>00:01:58</timestamp>
<p>Well, guess what.
</p><timestamp>00:02:00</timestamp>
<p>I spent as much time with you
as you did with me.
</p><timestamp>00:02:02</timestamp>
<p>Why don't I write a book about
how you married Mr. Peanutbutter
because he's too dumb to see how
much better you think you are?
</p><timestamp>00:02:08</timestamp>
<p>- Okay, I know you're upset--
- I'm not upset.
</p><timestamp>00:02:11</timestamp>
<p>I'm just sick of nerd-girls like
you beating up on stars like me.
</p><timestamp>00:02:14</timestamp>
<p>It's pathetic!
I'm sorry no one wanted
to date you
in high school, Diane,
but I don't see why I have
to suffer just because
you were never especially
pretty or interesting.
</p><timestamp>00:02:23</timestamp>
<p>You really let me down,
BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:02:26</timestamp>
<p>You really let me down.
</p><timestamp>00:02:27</timestamp>
<p>I apologize for her outbursts.
</p><timestamp>00:02:30</timestamp>
<p>So, you really think you could
write a better book by Friday?
</p><timestamp>00:02:33</timestamp>
<p>Damn right I can, so you
can throw this turd of a book
in the garbage and then
light the garbage on fire.
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>In fact, you can burn all books,
because my book,
written by me,
is gonna kick your dick off.

the book, bozo?
</p><timestamp>00:03:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Diane's version is great.

<p>{\an8}Ahem. "The only
longstanding relationship
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}in BoJack's life is with
his agent, Princess Carolyn.
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Her loyalty must come
from a deep-rooted faith
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}that she's talented enough
to sustain the career of a man
society perceives as a joke."
</p><timestamp>00:04:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Uh, yeah, I would say that
I'm not such a fan of that one.
</p><timestamp>00:04:22</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Look, all publicity
is good publicity.
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}That guy who killed all those
teachers and ate their fingers?
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}He just got married in jail,
and when this book comes out,
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}you could be that guy.
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Oh, don't you get it?
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>This is my last chance
to make people love me again.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>If this goes out, everybody's
gonna see the real me.
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Now, I spend a lot of time
with the real me,
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and believe me,
nobody's gonna love that guy.
</p><timestamp>00:04:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- Okay.
- Now if you'll excuse me,
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I need to go take a shower
</p><timestamp>00:04:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so I can't tell
if I'm crying or not.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}All right, let's get to work.

<p>I feel like we can

</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ah, Copperplate, a font
for the truly modern man.
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>Ha. No.
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>There you are, Verdana.
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>Thought you could hide at the
end of the alphabet, did ya?

<p>Oh, Comic Sans,
you drunk, go home.
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>

I just spent six hours
playing with fonts?
Holy shit!

<p>Okay, focus BoJack, focus.
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>Here comes the focus.

<p><i>to impress me</i>

</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>

<p>Sarah Lynn, I know things
got kind of out of hand
last time when I tried to
make you stop doing drugs.
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>So I just want to thank you
for coming over this time
to give me drugs.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>Well, you can't go wrong
with Dr. Hu's drugs.
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>They're from another dimension.
</p><timestamp>00:08:06</timestamp>
<p>These are gonna help me
focus and get work done, right?
</p><timestamp>00:08:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yes. These are what
I give college students
so when they come to, their term
papers have written themselves.
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>That's exactly what he needs.
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>
<p>Also, I should probably
do another one.

<p>Oh, it's "Hu."
Dr. Hu.
</p><timestamp>00:08:22</timestamp>
<p>That's right, Dr. Hu.
Dr. Allen Hu.
</p><timestamp>00:08:24</timestamp>
<p>No, no, no, but I thought
it was "Who," like <i>Doctor Who.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>Yes, that's exactly
what it's like.
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>No, not H-U, but, "who,"
like, "Hello, who is it?"
</p><timestamp>00:08:32</timestamp>
<p>Uh, I don't know.
Who is it?
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, is this a joke?
Is he telling a joke
</p><timestamp>00:08:36</timestamp>
<p>- that I just don't--
- Hard to tell.

<p>Sometimes I just laugh after he
talks so he'll leave me alone.

talking about-- <i>Doctor Who.</i>

<p>What?
No, that's Dr. Quinn.
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>- Who's Dr. Quinn?
- I most certainly am not.

<p>I want you to take three
of these every hour
and take two of these
every 1/2 hour.
</p><timestamp>00:09:15</timestamp>
<p>Whatever you do, don't take
more than four of these
every 90 minutes, and take
the first two of the three
before you take
the second two of the four.

<p>And don't expose yourself
to bright light or get wet.

<p>Great! I'm writing
about that time

best friends.

best to pretty good?

<p>Sarah Lynn, how's it coming with
the <i>Horsin' Around</i> years?
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>Almost done with the story
where Hulk Hogan guest starred
and told us to say no to drugs.
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>Great.
Keep typing, monkeys.
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>If only Hulk Hogan
could see us now, right?
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>Because Sarah Lynn said
the thing about Hulk Hogan?
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>That was like four hours ago.
</p><timestamp>00:10:13</timestamp>
<p>Oh, uh, right.
</p><timestamp>00:10:15</timestamp>
<p>- How we doing now?
- Sending.
</p><timestamp>00:10:17</timestamp>
<p>- Just about to send.
- Nice.
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>Okay, this is great.
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>That puts us at 216 pages?
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>Holy shit, that's almost as long
as <i>The Firm</i> by John Grisham.
</p><timestamp>00:10:26</timestamp>
<p>And we just needed
to get to 200, right?
</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>
<p>I'm just gonna keep writing.
</p><timestamp>00:10:29</timestamp>
<p>I got a lot of synapses
firing right now.
</p><timestamp>00:10:32</timestamp>

<p>It's a beach read you can

<p>"Ow, my fingers are cramping

</p><timestamp>00:10:45</timestamp>
<p>Did Diane really say that?
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>No, but my fingers

</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>Good one.
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>We just need a way
to end this thing.
</p><timestamp>00:11:01</timestamp>
<p>What should the ending be?
</p><timestamp>00:11:03</timestamp>
<p>Maybe it was Earth all along.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>Not that,
but something like that.
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>

<p>- What?
- Your idea for the ending.
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>- Oh, what'd I say?
- About Maine.
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>About how you end up in Maine.
</p><timestamp>00:11:34</timestamp>
<p>I like the part where you swim
in the lake in the summers.
</p><timestamp>00:11:36</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, right, and when I get
too old to take care of myself,
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>

<p>- You got something better?
- Wait a minute.
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>Maybe we don't know
the ending yet
because you haven't lived it.
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I mean,
if you want to, like, finish

have to, like, die tonight.

<p>Okay, so what did we learn?
</p><timestamp>00:12:39</timestamp>
<p>We learned that if
we're going to do drugs
we should do them at home where
it's safe to do them together,
right, Todd?
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>- No!
- Ahh!
</p><timestamp>00:12:47</timestamp>
<p>Don't worry, guys.
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>I have this gun to keep
us safe from intruders.
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>- And each other.
- Wait, wait, wait.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>Is that just
your gun-shaped lighter,
or your lighter-shaped gun?
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>Shit, I guess it's my gun.
</p><timestamp>00:13:00</timestamp>
<p>Then what'd I do
with my lighter?
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>And what did I give
to that baby?
</p><timestamp>00:13:03</timestamp>
<p>Ha, I have a gun, too.
</p><timestamp>00:13:05</timestamp>
<p>Don't be a Silly Billy.
That's a broom.
</p><timestamp>00:13:09</timestamp>
<p>Wait, am I holding a gun?
</p><timestamp>00:13:11</timestamp>
<p>Todd, are you holding
a gun or a broom?
</p><timestamp>00:13:14</timestamp>
<p>I can't tell anymore!
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>I guess we'll just have
to shoot them at each other
at the same time to find out!
</p><timestamp>00:13:22</timestamp>
<p>Okay!
</p><timestamp>00:13:24</timestamp>
<p>Todd, sh-- Oh-- Can I just say--
Todd, Todd, I need you--
</p><timestamp>00:13:26</timestamp>
<p>I need you to shh.
Listen, listen, Todd.
</p><timestamp>00:13:28</timestamp>
<p>Okay, just to be totally clear,
we're shooting each other
to determine whether we're
holding guns or brooms, right?
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>Not because you're still mad
about the whole
me sabotaging you
with the rock opera

and suchety-such?
</p><timestamp>00:13:38</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, shh, shh, okay, Bo?

<p>Quiet, quiet,

</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>
<p>As you know, I was hurt,
but then I realized
that's just how you are.
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>You know, and maybe I just
need to stop expecting you
to be a good person,
so that way, I won't
get hurt when you're not.
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p>Oh, o-- Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>Hey, this isn't fair.
</p><timestamp>00:13:56</timestamp>
<p>I don't have a gun.
</p><timestamp>00:13:58</timestamp>
<p>Sarah Lynn is right.
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>You know, if we all had guns,
then no one would need a gun,
and we would all be safe.
</p><timestamp>00:14:03</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God.
</p><timestamp>00:14:04</timestamp>

<p>Where do the stars go?
</p><timestamp>00:20:42</timestamp>
<p>Oh, they're still there.
</p><timestamp>00:20:43</timestamp>
<p>We just can't see them
because the sun is shining.
</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p>- Oh. Daddy?
- Harper?
</p><timestamp>00:20:48</timestamp>
<p>Do you think if you were a
little kid, we would be friends?
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>
<p>Well, that depends.
</p><timestamp>00:20:54</timestamp>
<p>Do you love cookies,
and the color green, and braids?
</p><timestamp>00:20:56</timestamp>
<p>Yes, I love all those things.
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>Hello?
</p><timestamp>00:21:44</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I read the pages
you sent me last night,
and I have to tell you,
your book is absolutely,
without a doubt, the most...
gibberish.
</p><timestamp>00:21:53</timestamp>
<p><i>- It's gibberish.</i>
- What day is it?
</p><timestamp>00:21:55</timestamp>
<p>Let's see what you got here.
</p><timestamp>00:21:57</timestamp>
<p>You got 20 pages of
<i>Doctor Who</i> erotic fan fiction,
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>
<p><i>a recipe for soup,</i>
<i>five different theories</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p><i>about how 9/11 happened,</i>
and a bunch
of embedded YouTube videos
that can't possibly
be printed in book form.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>- Okay, I gotta go.

</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>Any questions, at all,
for our panel of ghostwriters?
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>Um, yeah, I have a question
for Tori Spelling.
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>Again, Tori Spelling is not
here, as I already explained.
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>Tori Spelling's
ghostwriter is here.
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>This is a ghostwriter
convention.
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>How do you not--
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>clears throat</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>Okay, next question?
</p><timestamp>00:22:34</timestamp>
<p>Uh, yeah,
this is for the whole panel.
</p><timestamp>00:22:36</timestamp>
<p>What's your favorite kind
of ghost to write for?
</p><timestamp>00:22:39</timestamp>
<p>What?
No, they don't write for ghosts.
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p>That's not wha-- Why did I think
this would be a good idea?
</p><timestamp>00:22:45</timestamp>
<p>Does anyone have
an actual question
for someone on this panel?
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p>An actual question, or a gun,
so I can shoot myself?
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> <i>Yeah, I got a question.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:56</timestamp>
<p>Oh, thank God.

My question is for Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>Look, I'm sorry about all the
stuff I said about you earlier.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>We can publish
the book you wrote.
</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p>You're obviously a better
writer than I am,
and I don't actually
even really care
what the world thinks
about me anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>I just hated reading that book
because I hated feeling like
that's how you saw me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>Because I guess you know me
better than anybody,
and if you think that--
</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p>Um, I guess my question is, do you--
</p><timestamp>00:23:24</timestamp>
<p>Do you think
it's too late for me?
</p><timestamp>00:23:26</timestamp>
<p>What?
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>
<p>I mean, am I just doomed
to be the person that I am?
</p><timestamp>00:23:30</timestamp>
<p>The-- The person in that book?
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>It's not too late for me, is it?
It's-- It's not too late--
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>Diane, I need you to tell me
that it's not too late.
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p>- BoJack, I--
- I-- I need you to tell me
that I'm a good person.
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>I know that I can be selfish
and narcissistic
and self-destructive,
but underneath all that,
deep down, I'm a good person,
and I need you to tell me
that I'm good, Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>Tell me, please, Diane.
Tell me that I'm good.
