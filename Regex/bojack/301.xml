<p>What's it like to play Secretariat?

<p>Dream come true.
</p><timestamp>00:00:25</timestamp>
<p>Playing Secretariat, what was that like?

<i>How long you in New York for?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:00:31</timestamp>
<p>Just a couple days of fun interviews,
then it's off to Chicago
for more fun interviews,
and then, if I don't blow my brains out,
I get to go back to L.A.
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>Darling, you're doing marvelously,
I am so proud of you.
</p><timestamp>00:00:42</timestamp>
<p>If I could make one slight adjustment?
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>Maybe fewer jokes
about how these interviews
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p>- make you want to blow your brains out?
- Right. Sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p>I am so thrilled to be here,
talking with, uh...
</p><timestamp>00:00:51</timestamp>
<p>-Yahoo Finland.
-Yahoo Finland.
</p><timestamp>00:00:53</timestamp>
<p>- Are you Finnish?
- No, we are just getting started.
</p><timestamp>00:00:56</timestamp>
<p>Walked right into that one.
</p><timestamp>00:00:57</timestamp>
<p>What would an Oscar nomination
mean for Mr. BoJack Horseman?
</p><timestamp>00:01:02</timestamp>
<p>Any award recognition is just gravy.
</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p>The real joy is to sit
in this hotel room all day,
answering the same questions
over and over again.
</p><timestamp>00:01:08</timestamp>
<p>Great answers, you're divine.
I'm in love with you.
</p><timestamp>00:01:11</timestamp>
<p>One small adjustment.
I don't think sarcasm is going to read.
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>Just write a script for me,
so I don't have to think for myself.
</p><timestamp>00:01:17</timestamp>
<p>Honey, I would shove my hand
up your ass
and control your mouth like a Muppet
if it would win you an Oscar.
</p><timestamp>00:01:22</timestamp>
<p>What do I know?
</p><timestamp>00:01:23</timestamp>
<p>I'm just the publicist you hired
to help win you an Oscar.

<p><subtitle>woman</subtitle>
<i>What's it like to play Seabiscuit?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:29</timestamp>
<p>I don't know.
You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.
</p><timestamp>00:01:31</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man</subtitle> Your last attempt at a comeback
was <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:01:34</timestamp>
<p>Pass.
</p><timestamp>00:01:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>man 2</subtitle> People still see you as the guy
from that sucky show from the '90s.
</p><timestamp>00:01:38</timestamp>
<p><i>Horsin' Around </i>was not a sucky show.
</p><timestamp>00:01:40</timestamp>
<p>- Yeah, but it was.
- It lasted nine seasons.
</p><timestamp>00:01:43</timestamp>
<p>Its whole purpose
was for people to watch it
so the network could sell ad time,
so the show could make more money
than it cost to produce.
</p><timestamp>00:01:49</timestamp>
<p>It did that well. It was a good show.
</p><timestamp>00:01:51</timestamp>
<p>- Yes, but it sucked.
- It didn't suck!
</p><timestamp>00:01:56</timestamp>
<p>Great job today.
It could not have gone better.
</p><timestamp>00:01:58</timestamp>
<p>My only note would be
stop defending <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:01</timestamp>
<p>Why? Millions of people loved it!
</p><timestamp>00:02:03</timestamp>
<p>We need to use these next few months
to define your story.
</p><timestamp>00:02:06</timestamp>
<p>When people see you
they need to think Oscar winner,
not dumb asshole from an old TV show
that nobody cares about.
</p><timestamp>00:02:13</timestamp>
<p>Okay, I hear what you're saying,
but we can both agree <i>Horsin' Around</i>
was a good show, right?
</p><timestamp>00:02:17</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, you know
I think the world of you.
</p><timestamp>00:02:19</timestamp>
<p>I think you are so smart and attractive,
so I'm not going to mince words.
</p><timestamp>00:02:23</timestamp>
<p><i>Horsin' Around </i>was a piece of shit.

<p>{\an8}Looking good. Fantastic.
You need a coaster.
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I told you to wear lipstick
and underpants, Teresa.
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I put everything bill-related
in one folder.
</p><timestamp>00:03:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Gas bill, cable bill,
and the new headshots for Billy Zane.
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p>- Thank you, Judah.
- You also wanted me to remind you
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>- to call Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>Ping me again in two minutes?
No, five minutes.
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>Uh, when's our call
with BoJack and Spanakopita?
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}The one that started seven minutes ago?
It started seven minutes ago.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What?
</p><timestamp>00:03:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Diane's in your office right now,
stalling... poorly.
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And that is my opinion on the Octomom.
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Remember Octomom?
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>Ana</subtitle> <i>Diane, are you stalling</i>
<i>for Princess Carolyn?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What? You know who was good at stallin'
was Joseph Stalin. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> <i>If anything,</i>
<i>Stalin was ruthlessly efficient.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p><i>Get your head out of your ass.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}He also had a city named after him.
Isn't that right, Princess Carolyn,
</p><timestamp>00:04:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- who's been here the whole time?
- Hey, buddy.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}How was your first big day
at the press junket?
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Endless. It was like
the second act of a Judd Apatow movie.
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>
<p>He was exquisite.
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>The movie's tracking really well
on social.
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>New media impressions are up
23 percent across platforms.
</p><timestamp>00:04:23</timestamp>
<p>What does that mean?
</p><timestamp>00:04:25</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I have no idea.
I assumed you would know.
</p><timestamp>00:04:27</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>clears throat</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}But I keep tweeting things
and they keep getting retweeted,
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}so we're doing something right.
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>Yesterday I dropped my phone
in the bathroom
which made BoJack's Instagram
post a picture of the floor,
with the caption "<i>spujb."</i>
That got 4000 likes.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- <subtitle>Ana</subtitle> <i>Great.</i>
- I am exhausted.
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Being a movie star is the hardest job.
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And we get no recognition.
<subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>Okay, you're gonna love this.
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>I pulled some strings at <i>Manatee Fair</i>
and set up an interview tomorrow night.
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>BoJack is not ready
for a magazine feature.
</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>Relax. It's not that big a deal.
</p><timestamp>00:04:56</timestamp>
<p>I didn't realize
you were an authority on deal size.
</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Princess Carolyn</subtitle>
<i>Listen, Moussaka...</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ladies, please.
There's plenty of BoJack to go around.
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>I can do all the bullshit things
Ana's scheduled for me in the morning
and still have time for Princess Carolyn's
bullshit thing tomorrow night.
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p>Now, pajamas.
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>- Whaa!

<p>- Todd?!

<p><subtitle>Ana</subtitle> <i>BoJack smuggled</i>
<i>a young boy into his room.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>No big deal.
Movie stars do it all the time.

<p>{\an8}Where am I? <subtitle>sniffs</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}- Am I in Minneapolis?
- What? No, you're in New York.
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Follow-up: why are you in New York?
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Beats me. Sometimes I just am places.

<p>- Ohh...

</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>You're my friend
and you don't stink of failure.
</p><timestamp>00:06:23</timestamp>
<p>Your stink is one of good intentions

<p><subtitle>Todd</subtitle>
<i>Hooray, compliment!</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>You wanted me to ping you
regarding Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>Oh, fish! Guys, hold on,
I have to make a quick call.
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>- What? You're already on a call.

<p>I wanted to remind you
of your meeting with Pinky today.

<p><subtitle>annoyed throat clearing</subtitle>

<p>- Do I need to be on this call still?

</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>- BoJack Horseman, is that you?!
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:06:53</timestamp>

you posted yesterday.

<p>You don't need to patronize me.

<p>Oh, no.
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>Hello? Are you still there?
</p><timestamp>00:08:47</timestamp>
<p>- They may have hung up.
- I have some good news for once.
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>I just got promoted
to head of programming.
</p><timestamp>00:08:53</timestamp>
<p>I'm no longer a passenger
on the burning wreckage of an industry
that is broadcast television.
</p><timestamp>00:08:59</timestamp>
<p>- I'm a captain!
- What happened to Wanda?
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>You didn't hear? She got poached.
</p><timestamp>00:09:03</timestamp>
<p>- Oh, God!
- By another company.
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>Oh, good.
</p><timestamp>00:09:06</timestamp>
<p>- They shot her.
- Oh, God!
</p><timestamp>00:09:08</timestamp>
<p>Straight to the top
of the corporate ladder!
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>- Oh, good.
- She had to move to Detroit.
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p>- Oh, God!
- Which I hear is due for a resurgence.
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>Can we get to the goddamn point, please?
</p><timestamp>00:09:19</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, the network
is finally breaking even,
thanks to the runaway success
of <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

<p><i>What Do They Know?</i>
<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!</i>

<p>Wait, what? Why?!
</p><timestamp>00:09:38</timestamp>
<p>I told the story I wanted to tell.
</p><timestamp>00:09:40</timestamp>
<p>To prolong it for commercial reasons
would be crass and inorganic.
</p><timestamp>00:09:43</timestamp>
<p>Uh...

<p>At long last the public knows
what Hollywoo stars and celebrities know

<p>- and what they don't know.

</p><timestamp>00:09:53</timestamp>
<p>Why does everything I love fall apart
as soon as I touch it?

</p><timestamp>00:11:54</timestamp>
<p>I'm not interested in being rebirthed.

</p><timestamp>00:11:58</timestamp>
<p>Jill, I'm not the guy who does things
that are challenging,
or edgy, or covered in milk.

<p>I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.
I'm thinking about my legacy now.
</p><timestamp>00:12:06</timestamp>

<p>That's the whole point, nothing lasts.

<p>No, I know, but see, years after I die,
people will still be able

</p><timestamp>00:12:16</timestamp>

- And then...
</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p>I'll be remembered.
If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>- And then what?
- Then my life will have meaning.
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>- I don't know!
- Mm-hmm.

</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>Two hours long without an intermission?
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>It's that he's a marionette.
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>And he doesn't even know someone else
is pulling his strings.
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p>Mmm, I don't think the chef
whispered his dreams into this.

<p>This does not taste like dreams.

</p><timestamp>00:13:29</timestamp>
<p>- On a provisional basis, of course.
- Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:13:32</timestamp>
<p>But we're a small agency
and we need to think like one.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>Instead of spreading ourselves thinner,
we should focus on better gigs

<p><subtitle>drowsily</subtitle> Is that BoJack Horseman?
What is this, a crossover episode?
</p><timestamp>00:20:10</timestamp>
<p>What do you want?
</p><timestamp>00:20:12</timestamp>
<p>Let's say, hypothetically,
you had some information about me.
</p><timestamp>00:20:16</timestamp>
<p>You were gonna write about it,
</p><timestamp>00:20:17</timestamp>
<p><i>I wanted to stop you</i>
<i>before you could get it published.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:20</timestamp>
<p>What would be a smart thing
I could do in that situation
that would change your mind?
</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>Are we fighting about the book again?
</p><timestamp>00:20:26</timestamp>
<p>I don't remember
where we left off last time.
</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>No. Diane, not everything is about you.
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p><i>For once, I have a problem,</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>Okay, walk me through it again?
</p><timestamp>00:20:34</timestamp>
<p>I don't have time!
It's already three hours later here!
</p><timestamp>00:20:37</timestamp>
<p>Thanks a lot. Once again,
you've been no help whatsoever.
</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>Spoiler from the future, you suck.
</p><timestamp>00:20:43</timestamp>
<p><i>Sorry, you don't suck. I'm just...</i>
<i>very stressed out right now. Bye.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh, come on, come on.
</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>I'm aware of the situation
and I'm handling it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:53</timestamp>
<p>- But I haven't even--
- I'm handling it.
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>I'll see you at the screening tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:20:57</timestamp>
<p>- But...
- Don't be late.
</p><timestamp>00:20:59</timestamp>
<p>- BoJack!
- Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:21:01</timestamp>
<p>There you are. Stay right there.
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>You will not <i>believe </i>the night I had.
</p><timestamp>00:21:05</timestamp>
<p>- This city will eat you alive.
- Did you get the ice?
</p><timestamp>00:21:08</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:10</timestamp>
<p>I'll be right back.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>I'm lost again!
</p><timestamp>00:21:17</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Peanutbutter</subtitle>
<i>All right, Oxnard.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:21:18</timestamp>
<p>We are looking at
a once in a lifetime opportunity.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>Too bad Todd's not here.
</p><timestamp>00:21:24</timestamp>
<p>He's always the best
at coming up with ideas
that at first might seem terrible...
</p><timestamp>00:21:29</timestamp>
<p>Right.
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>If he was here,
he'd probably say something like,
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>"Hey, you know what's cool?
Spaghetti strainers!"
</p><timestamp>00:21:35</timestamp>
<p>Go on.
</p><timestamp>00:21:37</timestamp>
<p>And you'd say, "I feel like
I've seen that somewhere before."
</p><timestamp>00:21:40</timestamp>
<p>Hah! That is so me!
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>And then he'd say, "What if I told you
that this spaghetti strainer
is also a hat?"
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat?
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>That is a brilliant idea!
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>That's a terrible idea.
That's my point!
</p><timestamp>00:21:56</timestamp>
<p>Put that in the maybe pile.
</p><timestamp>00:21:57</timestamp>
<p>Right now, we need to focus
on TV shows.
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure Todd would suggest,
</p><timestamp>00:22:01</timestamp>
<p><i>A Spaghetti Strainer</i>
<i>That's Also A Hat: The TV Show.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:05</timestamp>
<p>That's it! Todd, you've done it again.
</p><timestamp>00:22:07</timestamp>
<p>No! Nobody's done anything.
</p><timestamp>00:22:09</timestamp>
<p>Oxnard, I want you to buy out
the entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.
</p><timestamp>00:22:13</timestamp>
<p>I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>I'm putting all my money
in spaghetti strainers for this show.
</p><timestamp>00:22:18</timestamp>
<p>- How is this a show?
- Don't ask me. It's your idea.
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>vehicle stopping</subtitle>
- <subtitle>door opens, closes</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>I took care of our problem.
</p><timestamp>00:22:30</timestamp>
<p>What did you do?
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>You don't need to know anything else.
It's been taken care of.
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>Ana...
</p><timestamp>00:22:37</timestamp>
<p>There-- There was a moment
back at the hotel where...
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>I really thought I blew it,
I was scared it was all over, and--
</p><timestamp>00:22:43</timestamp>
<p>And then after, I was relieved.
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>
<p>I don't know if I should win an Oscar.
</p><timestamp>00:22:49</timestamp>
<p>- I don't know if I want to.
- Stop punishing yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>I was in New Mexico.
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p>None of that matters.
All that matters now is the story.
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>We get to decide what our story is.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>Nobody else gets to tell you
what your story is.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>- What is my story?
- I'll tell you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p>This has been your dream for the last
30 years. You made it happen.
</p><timestamp>00:23:09</timestamp>
<p>An Oscar won't make you happy forever,
it won't solve all your problems.
</p><timestamp>00:23:13</timestamp>
<p>You win that Oscar,
the next day you go back to being you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:17</timestamp>
<p>But that night is a really good night.
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p>I think you deserve a really good night,
and I know how to get you there.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>Do you want that?
</p><timestamp>00:23:28</timestamp>
<p>Yes, I do.
</p><timestamp>00:23:30</timestamp>
<p>Go introduce your movie. Tell your story.
</p><timestamp>00:23:33</timestamp>
<p>Tomorrow we fly to Chicago.
</p><timestamp>00:23:38</timestamp>
<p><i>Being Secretariat</i>
<i>isn't just about running fast.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p><i>Secretariat's a state of mind.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:43</timestamp>
<p><i>It's about doing the right thing,</i>
<i>standing up for yourself.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p><i>Why, I look around and I see</i>
<i>a whole room full of Secretariats.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:52</timestamp>
<p><i>You are Secretariat.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:54</timestamp>
<p><i>And you are Secretariat.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p><i>And you... are Secretariat.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:24:03</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, it's such a beautiful movie
and I think such a textured performance.
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>When you were on <i>Horsin' Around</i>,
could you ever have imagined
that you'd give a performance like this?
</p><timestamp>00:24:12</timestamp>
<p>- Yes. Actually, I imagined it a lot.
- <subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>I always knew I was more
than just a dumb TV actor.
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>
<p>Even if other people
didn't always know that.
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>- <subtitle>laughter</subtitle>
- Seriously, though...
that TV show...
it wasn't me.
</p><timestamp>00:24:29</timestamp>
<p>This movie is me.
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>And I can't tell you how great it feels
to finally be doing
the kind of work that I can be proud of.
</p><timestamp>00:24:37</timestamp>
