<p>Let me be the first to tell you:
I'm bad news.
</p><timestamp>00:00:16</timestamp>
<p>You're actually not the first
to tell me that.
</p><timestamp>00:00:18</timestamp>
<p>I can't offer you parental guidance
or advice or love or support
or prolonged conversation
or interest in you,
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>-or remembering your name.
-It's Hollyhock.
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>-And I'm not looking for another dad.
-Great.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>But I've always wanted to know
who my mother is.
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>Your mother? What do I look like,
Josh Radnor?
</p><timestamp>00:00:35</timestamp>
<p>Nothing? Nothing for Josh Radnor.
How quickly we forget.
</p><timestamp>00:00:38</timestamp>
<p>Just tell me the name of the woman
you had sex with in December 1999.
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p>That's all the relationship
we need to have.
</p><timestamp>00:00:46</timestamp>
<p>That was quite a time
for our nation, sex-wise...
</p><timestamp>00:00:48</timestamp>
<p><music> Oh, 1999</music>
</p><timestamp>00:00:52</timestamp>
<p>Actually, I don't need a whole long story.
Just get to the point.
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>The point is I banged a lot of women.
</p><timestamp>00:00:58</timestamp>
<p>One-night stands, two-night stands,
nooners, spooners, hot-air ballooners.
</p><timestamp>00:01:01</timestamp>
<p>So, out of all of these women
it sounds like you really respected,
is there any chance
one of them got pregnant
and then put the baby up for adoption?
</p><timestamp>00:01:10</timestamp>
<p>I guess Marcy was kind of
a poking holes in the condom type.
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p>Real nutter. Good lay, though.
</p><timestamp>00:01:15</timestamp>
<p>Glad to hear my mother
was a "nutter" and "a good lay."
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>Can I meet her? Where is she?
</p><timestamp>00:01:20</timestamp>
<p>I bet she's still in that same apartment
in the Valley. What a dump!
</p><timestamp>00:01:23</timestamp>
<p>Can you take me there?
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>Help me find my mom
and I'll leave you alone forever.
</p><timestamp>00:01:27</timestamp>
<p>Deal. But can we go in the morning?
</p><timestamp>00:01:29</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>yawning</subtitle> It's getting pretty late,
I become a real asshole
if I don't get a solid seven hours
of bed drinking a night.
</p><timestamp>00:01:34</timestamp>
<p>I should get going.
</p><timestamp>00:01:36</timestamp>
<p>My hostel's all the way downtown
in a pretty bad area.
</p><timestamp>00:01:40</timestamp>
<p>Wait.
</p><timestamp>00:01:42</timestamp>
<p>-Take this.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:01:44</timestamp>
<p>Here I go, hope there are
no murderers out.
</p><timestamp>00:01:48</timestamp>
<p>Yes, everyone hopes that all the time.
</p><timestamp>00:01:50</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, just do me a favor.
-Ugh! What now?
</p><timestamp>00:01:52</timestamp>
<p>If I do get murdered,
will you call my eight dads
and tell them I love them?
</p><timestamp>00:01:57</timestamp>
<p>I gotta call all eight? They can't
work out a phone tree? <subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:00</timestamp>
<p>If you're gonna be a baby,
stay here for the night.
</p><timestamp>00:02:02</timestamp>
<p>-All right!
-Take the couch and be quiet.
</p><timestamp>00:02:04</timestamp>
<p>Don't get on your phone and text
all your friends how sweet my house is.
</p><timestamp>00:02:07</timestamp>
<p>Turn off all the lights when you're
going to sleep, all of the lights.
</p><timestamp>00:02:15</timestamp>

<p>-<subtitle>Katrina</subtitle> Who gave Todd the air horn?
-Right.
</p><timestamp>00:03:29</timestamp>
<p>-The campaign.
-Exactly.
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>But it's just another two months, right?
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}After the election
everything goes back to normal.
</p><timestamp>00:03:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Well, unless I win.
-Right.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>I gotta tell you, I'm having a blast.
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>I always knew I was probably
good at something,
but I never knew what it was.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Thanks to Katrina, I've finally realized
I'm good at people liking me.
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>That's great, and you know
I'm so happy for you,
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}but do you have to be
the pro-fracking candidate?
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-<subtitle>shudders</subtitle>
-Diane, this is the campaign.
</p><timestamp>00:03:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Nothing anyone says
during a campaign matters.
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>It's just promising a bunch of stuff
to get people to vote for you.
</p><timestamp>00:04:03</timestamp>
<p>Then when you get an office,
you can do whatever you want.
</p><timestamp>00:04:06</timestamp>
<p>-Democracy in action.
-Mark my words--
the only fracking
that's going to be happening
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>-is in this bedroom.
-All right, guy.
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna drill you deep,
and fill you with a mysterious substance
that scientists still don't quite
understand the ramifications of.
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-This isn't sexy for me-- aaah!
-Did someone say "busy day"?
</p><timestamp>00:04:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No one said "busy day," Katrina.
What <i>did </i>we say about knocking?
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It wastes vital seconds
we'll never get back?
</p><timestamp>00:04:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Anyway, everyone who isn't me
needs to shut up right now.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-No one else was talking.
-I actually have good news for once.
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}CNN released a poll today,
and for the first time ever,
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Mr. Peanutbutter is up.
-Damn!
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>Wow! Am I John Davidson,
Cathy Lee Crosby
and Fran Tarkenton right now,
because that's--
</p><timestamp>00:04:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We don't have time for the reference
you're setting up.
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We're doing a presser in 30.
Go downstairs, get some breakfast.
</p><timestamp>00:04:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yeah! Breakfast!
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Am I Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald,
Judd Nelson, the principal...

</p><timestamp>00:04:59</timestamp>
<p>-Diane, you look sad.

</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>No, I'm saying you <i>look </i>sad.
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>Maybe you need to put on foundation,
blush around the cheeks or something.

<p>{\an8}What's going on down here?
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>I was trying to make you breakfast
to thank you for letting me stay here!
</p><timestamp>00:05:23</timestamp>
<p>I put a Pop-Tart in the microwave!
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>-Did you take the foil off?
-No! I was doing it popcorn style!
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>It's all right, it's not your fault.
Making food is impossible.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>Let's get out of here
and take you to your mom's house.
</p><timestamp>00:05:34</timestamp>
<p>Should we do something about the fire?
</p><timestamp>00:05:36</timestamp>

It'll tire itself out eventually.

<p>{\an8}So, who is this lady?
</p><timestamp>00:05:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It's actually a cute story.
She was the president of my fan club.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You had sex with the president
of your fan club?
</p><timestamp>00:05:47</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. "Oh, my God, what a monster!"
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>I slept with someone who loved me
more than anybody else
and dedicated her life to knowing things
about me and caring about me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>How could I be so shallow?
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You're right, I'm sorry.
Finish your cute story.
</p><timestamp>00:05:59</timestamp>
<p>That was the whole story.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>She was the president of my fan club,
I had sex with her.
</p><timestamp>00:06:03</timestamp>
<p>Then I didn't think about her
for 18 years, and here we are.

<p>Well, let's just say
it's more than Harry Potter movies,
but fewer than James Bond movies.
</p><timestamp>00:06:31</timestamp>
<p>-Doctor, no!
-What do you recommend?
</p><timestamp>00:06:33</timestamp>
<p>Hmm. Have you considered
impregnating a younger woman?
</p><timestamp>00:06:36</timestamp>
<p>No, I want to do it with this woman.
</p><timestamp>00:06:38</timestamp>
<p>You could try throwing money
at the problem.
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>You're gonna want pre-natal vitamins,
cervical mucus boosters,
a "You Can Do It!" poster,
and an iOvulate.

<p>- "iOvulate"?

<p>BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>Marcy, hey.
</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>-I knew it. I knew you'd come back.
-Right. Um...
here's a very specific question:
after we had sex,
did you by any chance get pregnant
and put a baby up for adoption?
</p><timestamp>00:07:16</timestamp>
<p>-Yes.
-Wait, really?
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, you're my mother.
Can I hug you?
</p><timestamp>00:07:20</timestamp>
<p>-I'm hugging my mother.
-Wow.
</p><timestamp>00:07:22</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I'm sorry,
I really wanted to tell you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:25</timestamp>
<p>But when I called the number
that you gave me,
it was for a sandwich shop in Temecula.
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>Wha...? That's so weird.
You must have dialed it wrong.
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>And then I thought, well, you know,
sooner or later you'd call me.
</p><timestamp>00:07:37</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I was gonna,
but then, you know, 9/11 happened...
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>-Can you ever forgive me?
-I think so.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>Oh! I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?
Please come in.
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>And that was just such
a tough time for our country...
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>So, once we introduced vicious knife-play
into our routine,
it really gave our sex life the edge.
</p><timestamp>00:08:01</timestamp>
<p>Love it, crooshed it.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>So the article is just about
a happy marriage with a healthy sex life?
</p><timestamp>00:08:05</timestamp>
<p>We already have Raquel's piece
about 69 days of sixty-nining.
</p><timestamp>00:08:08</timestamp>
<p>-Uh-huh!
-So croosh.
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>What about our readers
who <i>aren't</i> having sex with their husbands?
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>Isn't this just gonna make them feel bad?
</p><timestamp>00:08:14</timestamp>
<p>Not everyone gets to have
great sex all the time, right?
</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>Ladies?
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>Diane? Can I talk to you
in your office for a minute?
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>I don't have an office.
</p><timestamp>00:08:24</timestamp>
<p>You said offices have corners
and corners are the patriarchy.
</p><timestamp>00:08:27</timestamp>
<p>Fine. Can I talk to you in the hot-take,
cool-down yoga area?

</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p>You seem tense.

<p>Have you been eating gluten
and also not having sex with your husband?
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p>Whoa, Stefani, that's not--
</p><timestamp>00:08:40</timestamp>
<p>Diane, relax! This is not a conversation
between an employee and her superior.
</p><timestamp>00:08:46</timestamp>
<p>This is a conversation
between a friend and her superior.
</p><timestamp>00:08:50</timestamp>
<p>The campaign
has been testing our marriage.
</p><timestamp>00:08:53</timestamp>
<p>Obviously, it's great to see
Mr. Peanutbutter so excited,
and I am supporting that.
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>But if I'm being honest,
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>I can't wait for it to be over
so things can go back to normal.
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>-Hmm. And what happens if he wins?
-He's not going to win.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>Did you see the new CNN poll this morning?
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>He could win. People do love fracking.
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>It's fun to say! "Frack! Frack!
Fricky-fricky-frack" <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:14</timestamp>
<p>People wouldn't love saying it
if they understood what it actually was.
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>-So tell them.
-I can't go against my husband.
</p><timestamp>00:09:20</timestamp>
<p>What the frack? Why not?
You gotta do you, girl.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>I always say, you gotta do you.
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>And if he's doing him,
then who's doing you?
</p><timestamp>00:09:29</timestamp>
<p>Because right now,
it seems like no one's doing you.
</p><timestamp>00:09:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:35</timestamp>
<p>...and then when I was eight,
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>Lizzie Dunbar's mom rented us all
<i>Freaky Friday</i> for a sleepover,
and I got really sad because I realized
I didn't have a mom to switch bodies with.
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>Am I talking a lot?
I feel I'm talking a lot.
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>-Yes.
-Oh! I need to show you something.
</p><timestamp>00:09:49</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so this may seem cuckoo,
but I was so head over heels
in love with your father
that after we made sweet love,
and he didn't call me again,
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>I just got so jealous, so I made a list
of every girl he was with...
and I found their home addresses...
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>-Oh.
-...and drew Xs over their eyes.
</p><timestamp>00:10:05</timestamp>
<p>I'm loving this conversation
but I have to go the bathroom now,
for non-me being weirded out
by this conversation-related reasons.
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>I just keep thinking about
how different things would have been
if you'd have just called me.
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>We could have had a family together
for 18 loving years.
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>-That might have--

</p><timestamp>00:10:25</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>groans</subtitle> Kids. What?
</p><timestamp>00:10:26</timestamp>
<p>Can you join me
in the bathroom for a minute?
</p><timestamp>00:10:28</timestamp>
<p>What?! No!
</p><timestamp>00:10:29</timestamp>
<p>-Do you want me, sweetheart?
-No, it's a dad bathroom thing.
</p><timestamp>00:10:34</timestamp>
<p>Uh... Hollyhock?
</p><timestamp>00:10:36</timestamp>
<p>That woman is not my mother.
She's lying to us!
</p><timestamp>00:10:39</timestamp>
<p>Marcy? No way!
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>Look. This is from the premiere
of <i>Autumn in New York.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:10:43</timestamp>
<p>That movie came out in August of 2000.
I was born in September.
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>Does this woman look
eight months pregnant to you?
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>Why would they release a romantic drama
called <i>Autumn in New York</i>
in the middle of summer?
</p><timestamp>00:10:55</timestamp>
<p>Richard Gere
had just done <i>Runaway Bride,</i>
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>Winona Ryder was hot off
<i>Girl, Interrupted</i>
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p>-so the studio got cocky.
-How do you know all this?
</p><timestamp>00:11:01</timestamp>
<p>I looked it up on the Internet
because I saw this picture
and got confused why Marcy
would wear a summer dress
to a movie called
<i>Autumn in New York.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:11:09</timestamp>
<p>This is a summer dress?
I guess I don't know dresses.
</p><timestamp>00:11:12</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, focus! That's not my mom!
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>So the lesson here is
I was right to never call her.
</p><timestamp>00:11:17</timestamp>
<p>-Wait, so who--
-<subtitle>Marcy</subtitle> Are you okay in there?
</p><timestamp>00:11:19</timestamp>
<p>-Don't come in!
-Yes! Father-daughter bathroom time!
</p><timestamp>00:11:21</timestamp>
<p>The scrapbook! She has that list
of all the other women you slept with.
</p><timestamp>00:11:25</timestamp>
<p>If we get the book, we can find my mom.
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>Give me a few minutes. I'll distract her,
then you sneak in and grab the book.
</p><timestamp>00:11:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>And what was the first appearance
of the Horse's identical cousin?
</p><timestamp>00:11:38</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Marcy</subtitle> Season eight, episode four.
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Yeah, yeah. That's right.
What was the horse's boss's name?
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>-What are you doing?
-Oh, my God!
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>You're not supposed to see this.
Look away!
</p><timestamp>00:11:49</timestamp>
<p>It's okay, Hollyhock.
This is what Mommy and Daddy do.
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>-Ugh! You said give you a few minutes!
-I didn't think it would take this long.
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>I usually finish faster.
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p>-You're disgusting!
-<subtitle>moans</subtitle> That's what I needed.
</p><timestamp>00:12:04</timestamp>
<p>-Can I please have a grasshopper?
-<subtitle>seductively</subtitle> Yes?
</p><timestamp>00:12:07</timestamp>
<p>So the studio finished<i> Mars Attacks!</i>
without him.
</p><timestamp>00:12:10</timestamp>
<p>And since no one ever found a body,
my client Tony Tromboni
has been making movies
</p><timestamp>00:12:15</timestamp>
<p>-under the name Tim Burton ever since.
-Oh!
</p><timestamp>00:12:18</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:12:19</timestamp>
<p><i>Your ovulation window is closing soon.</i>

</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>Oh, fish! We gotta go.
</p><timestamp>00:12:25</timestamp>
<p>-Can't we finish lunch?
-You heard the bracelet.
</p><timestamp>00:12:27</timestamp>
<p>Okay, well, uh, let me get the check.
</p><timestamp>00:12:29</timestamp>
<p>-There's no time for that! Ralph!
-We gotta pay for our--
</p><timestamp>00:12:32</timestamp>
<p>I have an egg inside me
that is ripe to be fertilized.
</p><timestamp>00:12:35</timestamp>
<p>His name is Philbert.
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>-Princess Carolyn--
-Uh-uh! Philbert Stilton,
and he's going to be sweet and smart
and a phenom on the clarinet,
and one day you'll be driving him home
from band practice
and he's going to all of a sudden
say something so insightful and true
that you'll be positively floored
it came out of the mouth of your son.
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>But if you don't take me home right now
and impregnate me,
</p><timestamp>00:12:58</timestamp>
<p>-then Philbert will never exist.
-<subtitle>plates clatter</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:13:01</timestamp>
<p>Okay, let's go.
</p><timestamp>00:13:05</timestamp>
<p>-You told me to distract her.
-We don't need to talk about it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:08</timestamp>
<p>So now that we got the list,
we gotta go see all these other women?
</p><timestamp>00:13:11</timestamp>
<p>Not all of them,
just the ones you didn't see
in the nine months
after you had sex with them.
</p><timestamp>00:13:16</timestamp>
<p>-That's gonna be most of them.
-Yeah, figures.
</p><timestamp>00:13:18</timestamp>
<p>Ooh!
</p><timestamp>00:13:19</timestamp>
<p>Tilda Madison? You dated the Timedium,
Tuesdays at 9:00 on CBS?
</p><timestamp>00:13:24</timestamp>
<p>I never understood that show.
What's a Timedium?
</p><timestamp>00:13:27</timestamp>
<p>She's a medium,
but she can also travel through time
and she solves crimes.
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p>That's so stupid.
She time-travels and she's a medium?
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p>But the one crime she can't solve
is her husband's murder.

<p>So my name is Hollyhock and I love apples
but hate applesauce, too slimy.
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>I was the captain of the JV soccer team--
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, why did you bring this child
into my sanctum?
</p><timestamp>00:13:51</timestamp>
<p>I can make this real quick.
</p><timestamp>00:13:52</timestamp>
<p>Did you give up my secret baby
in the year 2000?
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh, BoJack, do you recall
the impetus for our uncoupling?
</p><timestamp>00:13:58</timestamp>
<p>Is every one of these
gonna be a whole thing?
</p><timestamp>00:14:00</timestamp>
<p>You were a cad and a boor.
</p><timestamp>00:14:02</timestamp>
<p>But your fits of sardonic japery amused,
to a point, until you impregnated me.
</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>
<p>Suddenly, I was awash in dreams
of idealized domesticity.
</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p>But when I told you I was with child,
</p><timestamp>00:14:14</timestamp>
<p>I received a check in the mail
for $200 with the memo line,
</p><timestamp>00:14:18</timestamp>
<p>"BoJack's half of the abortion."
</p><timestamp>00:14:20</timestamp>
<p>So you put me up for adoption?
</p><timestamp>00:14:21</timestamp>
<p>Child, no. I had the abortion.
</p><timestamp>00:14:23</timestamp>
<p>Nice. You don't want
any little BoJacks floating around.
</p><timestamp>00:14:26</timestamp>
<p>Last thing this world needs
is more of this garbage.
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p>-Uh, excuse me?
-No, you're great, you seem cool,
but if we could go back in time
and prevent it...
</p><timestamp>00:14:34</timestamp>
<p>-Right?
-<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:14:35</timestamp>
<p>Hollyhock, I didn't mean...

<p>{\an8}Beautifully put.
I'd like to drill down, as it were,
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-on the subject of fracking.
-Drill away.

<p>{\an8}Now, mere hours ago
your wife, Diane Nguyen,

<p>{\an8}"If these frack-happy politicians
even knew how dangerous it was,

<p>{\an8}Mr. Peanutbutter,
your wife has issued a challenge.
</p><timestamp>00:15:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Would you allow fracking
in your own backyard?

<p>{\an8}I would.

<p>{\an8}Mr. Peanutbutter has invited you

<p>{\an8}-Uh--
-Will you take him up on this invitation?
</p><timestamp>00:16:14</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I could have a team there this afternoon.
-Oh...

or is it above 35?
</p><timestamp>00:16:38</timestamp>

<p>She said sleeping with me
is the worst thing she ever did.
</p><timestamp>00:17:23</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry it's so unpleasant for you
to have to interact
with women you were shitty to.
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>I don't understand
why we're even doing this.
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>You're never gonna switch bodies

<p>Aaah! How could you let him do this?
</p><timestamp>00:18:11</timestamp>
<p>You're the one who called his bluff.
Don't do that.

<p>"Stoopid Gurl" is just a subsection
of the main site.
</p><timestamp>00:18:32</timestamp>
<p>And my piece wasn't about
Mr. Peanutbutter, specifically.
</p><timestamp>00:18:35</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna cut this conversation short,
my time is more important than yours.
</p><timestamp>00:18:38</timestamp>
<p>This goes one of two ways.
</p><timestamp>00:18:40</timestamp>
<p>Either you shut up and be pretty,
or your approximation of that,
or don't support him, he resents you,
your marriage implodes.

<p>-Pick your poison.

<p>Not that I get to vote, but from

any of the old Horseman gunk
bouncing around in that brain of yours,
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>I gotta tell you right now
you should give up on looking for "enough"
because it will never be enough.

-Eww!
</p><timestamp>00:21:43</timestamp>
<p>-Stop that.
-I know, it's stupid.
</p><timestamp>00:21:48</timestamp>
<p>-There, there.
-You are so bad at this.
</p><timestamp>00:21:52</timestamp>
<p>What do your dads say when you cry?
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>They say it's okay to cry,
and that I shouldn't feel bad
about feeling bad.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>Well, that-- that's good advice, right?
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>They're really good dads.
I should probably get back to them.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>Oh. You don't have to leave right away.
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>Why don't you just
stay with me a bit longer?
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>At least until we find your mom.
</p><timestamp>00:22:11</timestamp>
<p>How are we supposed to do that?
Every name on that list was a dead end.
</p><timestamp>00:22:15</timestamp>
<p>Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:22:17</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. But what if I told you
there's a name that isn't on that list?
</p><timestamp>00:22:22</timestamp>
<p>Someone Marcy never knew about.
</p><timestamp>00:22:24</timestamp>
<p>What? Where is she now?
</p><timestamp>00:22:26</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. But you can stay with me
while we try to find her?
</p><timestamp>00:22:29</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Yeah. What's her name?
</p><timestamp>00:22:31</timestamp>
<p>Her name was Brown Car... la.
</p><timestamp>00:22:35</timestamp>
<p>Carla Mercedes Benz... Brown.
</p><timestamp>00:22:38</timestamp>
<p>"Carla Mercedes Benzbrown"?
Weird name.
</p><timestamp>00:22:42</timestamp>
<p>-You've got a weird name.
-I guess you're right.
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>
<p>Maybe that's the first thing
we'll talk about when I meet her.
</p><timestamp>00:22:47</timestamp>
<p>Mm-hmm?

</p><timestamp>00:22:53</timestamp>
<p>Diane, I know. I'm sorry about the trucks,
but you didn't give me much choice.
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>I know these last few days
have been crazy.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>-But this is the hard part.
-I need you to drop out of the race.
</p><timestamp>00:23:03</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Please, Mr. Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p>This isn't worth it.
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>I hear what you're saying
and I will try to be more conscientious
of your needs.
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p>-Drop out of the race.
-Because your needs are important.
</p><timestamp>00:23:14</timestamp>
<p>I've written another piece
for Girl Croosh.
</p><timestamp>00:23:16</timestamp>
<p>It's called
"The Case Against Mr. Peanutbutter."
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>When I hit this button,
the post goes live.
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p>Diane, don't.
</p><timestamp>00:23:22</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to.
And I won't, if you drop out of the race.
</p><timestamp>00:23:25</timestamp>
<p>Jesus, Diane. You can't do that.
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>Because you're the only one allowed
to make decisions for this family?
</p><timestamp>00:23:30</timestamp>
<p>No. Because it's gonna come off
as a weird lovers' spat
and it's just going to embarrass everyone.
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p>-Well, I'm sorry if I embarrass you.
-Oh, come on.
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>You told me you weren't going to frack,
and now I can't
turn on a faucet in my own home
without getting third-degree burns.
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I get it. So like always,
you're mad at someone,
so your solution is to air
your dirty laundry for everyone to see.
</p><timestamp>00:23:52</timestamp>
<p>No. This is not about <i>us.</i>
I don't want <i>you </i>to be governor
because you would be bad at it,
because you don't stand for anything.
