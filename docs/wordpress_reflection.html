            <h2>Wordpress Project Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project has shown me a code-free alternative for website development through Wordpress. I've built a basic four-page portfolio website (similar to this one) using Wordpress' tools.</p>
            <p>Wordpress, as a concept, is a nice thing to have in one's toolbelt provided they don't know how to code. However, various questionable design choices by the developers of Wordpress leave me with harsh feelings regarding it's usability. Wordpress is chock-full of clunky and over-complicated menus. Editing any one part of the website requires multiple superfluous steps. While the end product is nice and professional-looking, I find the process of creating them not worth the effort.</p>
            <p>I much prefer coding webpages by hand. Websites that are coded from the ground up (like this one) are much more customizable than a Wordpress site that was developed using pre-made templates. By combining HTML code with a CSS stylesheet, developers can hand-design and control each and every aspect of their site.</p>
            <p>My <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/wordpressportfolio/">Wordpress website</a> features a small selection of the content published here, as this is my main website. While my Wordpress site was made for the purposes of this project, this website I intend to continue to develop during my career.</p>
