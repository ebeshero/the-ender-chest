            <h2>Sol Traveler Analysis</h2>
        </section>
        <p>The video game I chose for this assignment was Sol Traveler, by Samurai Punk on itch.io. In this game, you play as a character who wakes up alone on an alien vessel. Your objective is to navigate the ship back home. To be honest, there isn't much to this game. It's clearly a beginner project for Samurai Punk (who seems to have made plenty of other games). What is here though is pretty cool.</p>
        <p>When you begin the game, you wake up in what I would call the "crew quarters" of the ship. It's a very small ship, only having 3 rooms (quarters, a dining hall, and the bridge).</p>

A fun holotable (which reminds me of the Millenium Falcon) and what you will find out is the engine controls for the ship.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>The main challenge of the game is figuring out how to fly the ship. It's not that hard to find out, but it is fun to have that small "eureka!" moment. One really cool touch I like about the environment here is the inclusion of alien glyphs on the controls for the ship.</p>

They are labeled in an alien language, which I thought was a cool touch to the environment. It reminded me of getting in a car and seeing "Engine Start" labeled above the ignition (or on the button, if its a push-to-start).</figcaption></figure>
        <p>The game itself was very short. There's only one planet (which you are supposed to fly to) and it's shown on a holographic map in the bridge so there isn't much difficulty finding it.</p>

        <p>There honestly isn't much more to note about the game. It's a fun little experiment about exploring a foreign environment, but there isn't much to it honestly. That's not to say it's bad, there's just not much here. I was a little curious about the spaceship itself, however. i was curious if there was an actual "ship" outside. And luckily, I was able to satisfy my curiosity.</p>
        <p>In the room you spawn in (the "crew quarters") there happens to be a small airlock. I was a little nervous about opening it, as usually that doesn't end well in space. However, I found I was able to open the airlock without taking damage, getting sucked out of the ship, nothing. I jumped outside of the ship, fully expecting to float due to zero gravity.</p>
        <figure class="videoGame"><img class="videoGame" src="images/solTravelership.png" alt="the space ship from Sol Traveler, pictured from the outside"/><img class="videoGame" src="images/solTravelerspace.png" alt="the space skybox from Sol Traveler"/><figcaption>Imagine my surprise when I began to plummet to the bottom of the level as soon as I stepped outside the ship.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>As you can see, the ship itself is only the inside. There is no outside. Which makes me curious as to why you can even get outside the ship, since you clearly aren't meant to be out there. I let myself fall for about 2 minutes and never hit a bottom.</p>
        <p>This did clue me into how the ship itself worked, though. After restarting the game (as you don't die when you fall out of the ship) I set the ship to fly forward and turn in a random direction, then jumped out again. I found that the ship itself doesn't actually move. Instead, the skybox and objects in space move and rotate around the ship level (which is set anchored in one spot) whenever the player interacts with the levers inside the ship.</p>
        <p>This is a fairly common tactic for space-based games. The popular online game Warframe uses this same technique in its spaceship-based gamemode Railjack.</p>
        <figure class="videoGame"><img class="videoGame" src="images/railjackcockpit.jpg" alt="the cockpit of a railjack from the game Warframe"/><figcaption>The cockpit of a railjack interceptor from Warframe. The player pilots the ship here, and a similar technique of rotating the skybox around the pilot is used in this gamemode just like Sol Traveler.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>As I said, there isn't much to the game, but that doesn't mean it's bad. There's only one ambient track, but it's very calm and "spacey" which fits nicely. The sound of flicking the levers is nice and clunky, it's very satisfying. I do think the sound of opening doors, the engines, and the music itself are quite loud. I also thought the default sensitivity of the camera was way too high, I had to lower the DPI on my mouse to play comfortably.</p>
        <p>Frankly, I would've liked a bigger ship to explore. I also would've enjoyed a bigger map, perhaps requiring the player to warp jump between different systems with different environments and planets. I know combat isn't really the focus of this game, but some kind of random even or danger would help keep the game from getting boring.</p>
