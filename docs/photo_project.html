<!--Make Your Mark 

" I just want the world to know I was here, that I matter." (Cyberpunk 2077) 

Nostalgia: a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations. The proper way to say the “warm fuzzy feelings” one might get when rewatching their favorite movie or remembering a fun time with their friends in high school. Nostalgia and human memory are powerful things. But with that power can come a fear of being snuffed out. That once you’re gone, you may not be remembered by anyone.  

Ernest Hemingway once said, “Every man has two deaths, when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name.” Many seek to leave a mark on this world, so that even after they are buried in the ground, people may yet say their name. Writing on the walls of a house as it’s being built, signing your name on a drawing you just finished, or the simple act of carving your name in a tree. All to say, “I was here!” 

These artifacts may evoke feelings of nostalgia in an observer. Maybe they make you wonder, “Why was that person so angry? Are those names carved in that tree still so in love?” 

Eventually, someone will be looking at those rocks with names scratched into them the same way we now look at ancient manuscripts of shopping lists, or Viking runes carved into Scottish burial tombs. 

At the end of the day, no one may remember your name, but maybe a small mark is all it takes to say, “I was here!” and let someone know you existed.
