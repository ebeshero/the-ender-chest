            <h2>Corpus Analysis</h2>
            <p>For my corpus analysis I've assembled a collection of horror texts to compare. For one, I have a collection of short stories by Stephen King called "The Night Shift." My other texts are a group of three 19th and 20th century books: Frankenstein, Dracula, and War of the Worlds. I'm interested in seeing how a contemporary author like King differs from more dated concepts of horror.</p>
            <p>Maybe the most obvious thing I noticed was the differences in the language used. Stephen King, being a modern author, uses contractions a lot more than the others (which you will see in the screenshots posted). Another thing I picked up on was a difference in the horror subjects and situations. In the older novels, the main horror subjects were unknown things, like Martians, vampires, and whatever you would call Frankenstein's monster. King (for the most part) writes about fairly "understandable" things.</p>

            <p>A strange aspect of King's horror that doesn't seem present in the older texts is the aspect of the police. In King's writing, the word "police" appears quite a few times. However, skimming the KWIC view seems to hint that the police is not very helpful in the context of the story. Perhaps this hints at another aspect of the modern horror of which King writes, the failure of societal systems meant to keep us safe.</p>
