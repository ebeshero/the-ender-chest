            <h2>Corpus Analysis</h2>
            <p class="corpus">For my corpus analysis I've assembled a collection of horror texts to compare. For one, I have a collection of short stories by Stephen King called "The Night Shift." My other texts are a group of three 19th and 20th century books: Frankenstein, Dracula, and War of the Worlds. I'm interested in seeing how a contemporary author like King differs from more dated concepts of horror.</p>
            <p class="corpus">Maybe the most obvious thing I noticed was the differences in the language used. Stephen King, being a modern author, uses contractions a lot more than the others (which you will see in the screenshots posted). Another thing I picked up on was a difference in the horror subjects and situations. In the older novels, the main horror subjects were unknown things, like Martians, vampires, and whatever you would call Frankenstein's monster. King (for the most part) writes about fairly "understandable" things.</p>

            <p class="corpus">A strange aspect of King's horror that doesn't seem present in the older texts is the aspect of the police. In King's writing, the word "police" appears quite a few times. However, skimming the KWIC view seems to hint that the police is not very helpful in the context of the story. Perhaps this hints at another aspect of the modern horror of which King writes, the failure of societal systems meant to keep us safe.</p>

            <p class="corpus">I tried looking the 6-grams for both the old stories as well as King, but couldn't really find anything that I hadn't already found from the 4-grams. I did again take note of King's use of contractions.</p>
            <figure class="corpus"><img src="images/corpus_images/dont_know.png" alt="a screenshot showing King using contractions in his work"/><figcaption>As you can see, King makes use of the contraction "don't" in his stories.</figcaption></figure>
            <figure class="corpus"><img src="images/corpus_images/do_not_know.png" alt="a screenshot showing the older stories no using contractions in his work"/><figcaption>Meanwhile, it is much more common for the older authors to write out "do not"</figcaption></figure>
            <p class="corpus">Next, I took to Voyant to try and find anything interesting. Unfortunately, I don't think I did. I found the cirrus visualizations interesting, however for some reason Voyant was not filtering out stop words today...</p>

                <figure class="corpus"><img src="images/corpus_images/nightshiftcirrus.png" alt="a cirrus graph of The Night Shift"/><figcaption>Not much of anything here.</figcaption></figure>
                <figure class="corpus"><img src="images/corpus_images/wowcirrus.png" alt="a cirrus graph of The Night Shift"/><figcaption>Unsurprisingly, Martians are mentioned a lot in War of the Worlds.</figcaption></figure>
                <p class="corpus">I actually think the cirrus graphs for Dracula and Frankenstein are the most interesting. They give a bit of a deeper look into their stories that the other visualizations don't provide.</p>
                <figure class="corpus"><img src="images/corpus_images/draculacirrus.png" alt="a cirrus graph of The Night Shift"/><figcaption>"Good" and "Night" are fairly prominent on the cirrus, and "Dracula" is nowhere to be seen. I think "good night" is pretty funny (though I suppose in the context of the story it is meant to be more ominous) due to vampire's tendancy to be active at night.</figcaption></figure>
                <figure class="corpus"><img src="images/corpus_images/frankensteincirrus.png" alt="a cirrus graph of The Night Shift"/><figcaption>"Death," "Thought," "Feelings," and "Mind" are all pretty big on the cirrus. I wonder how much of those are about people, and how many are about Frankenstein's Monster? I get a good idea of what Frankenstein is actually about from this cirrus. Not just about a monster, but about feelings, emotions, and the human condition.</figcaption></figure>
            </div>
            <p class="corpus">Unfortunately, I don't feel like I found anything interesting here. Beyond the differences in language (which were hard to find using n-grams) and vague allusions to the different types of horror that the different books tell, I'm actually not convinced Stephen King's writing is so different from these older authors.</p>
